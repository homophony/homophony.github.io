This exercise has two parts. Practice around the circle of fifths.

1.  Play the major scale up and down using 7th chords.

I^∆7^ II^-7^ III^-7^ IV^∆7^ V^7^ VI^-7^ VII^-Dim7^

2.  Play each chord as an arpeggio, but start on the 7th and play down to the root.

Notes: very easy to burn through this in C without thinking. G and F are decent, everything else is slow. Need to keep practicing the hard ones.
