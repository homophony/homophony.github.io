## 1/28

I suspect practice this week will be inspired by circle of fifths symmetry (as discussed in some previous posts) and [concepts of chords as vectors that go in a direction in chord space](https://homophony.quest/blog/27_1_28_24_symmetry/).

Sus practice.

- Drone on a C note
  - add one note from each side of the circle of fifths (F and G)
  - Play the C sus chord in a droney way across the keyboard spattering Cs and Fs and Gs everywhere
- Drone around the Circle of fifths.
  - transition to the next sus chord going clockwise (start playing G with C and D around it, then start playing D with G and A around it)
  - do the same thing but going anti-clockwise
  - get used to the sus
  
Rotate the fifth pairs, keep the drone the same

- Drone on a C note
  - add the F G around the C note
  - keep the C note, but start moving the other notes around the circle of the fifths.
  - F G -> C D -> G A -> D E -> etc.
  
Keep the fifth pairs the same, rotate the drone

- Drone on a C, add the F and G.
  - keep playing F and G, but rotate C through the circle of fifths
  - CFG -> FFG -> BbFG -> EbFG -> etc.
  
Throughout these exercises, try to keep track of what the note relationships are in whichever scale is considered the center.
