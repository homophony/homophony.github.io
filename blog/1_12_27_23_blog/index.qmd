I had some time at the end of my semester to play piano more than usual. This semester that meant I actually played the piano, instead of not playing the piano.

Clearly I need to make time for more piano. I'm hoping this blog will keep me somewhat organized and motivated to stay on target.

The blog is built with [quarto](https://quarto.org), and this post is just changing the structure a little bit so that each post is it's own post, rather than a bunch of posts on a single page.
