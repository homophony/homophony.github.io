Some of the audio is loud, be careful with volume. MIDI was mangled.

:::

If I'm going to mangle MIDI, I should at least stuff it with as many notes from a uniform distribution as I care to.

I will now attempt to randomize the pancakes out of a MIDI file until they splatter into a polyphonic volcano of mangled bliss (that's the dream scenario).

According to some quick research, it seems that fluid synth (that I'm using to quickly render MIDI files with premium cheese factor) has at least 128 voices of polyphony, which is enough to play all of the midi notes at the same time...potentially all in randomized voices.

Here's the plan. Will it blend? I don't know. I'm pretty sure the first part of the plan will blend quickly.

1. Create a piano roll matrix with 128 rows and enough columns of midi ticks for 30 seconds.
2. Completely randomize note occurrence across the whole matrix, such that any note could occur in any time point.
3. Increase the note density so that there is a lot of notes being randomly generated...maybe not all the way to 128 notes per tick, that seems too extreme (but what does that sound like !?!).
4. Bump this super fat rando matrix out to a midi file.
5. For the easy win, render it via fluid synth and listen to it.
6. Maybe this will be easy too, but I'd like to randomize the synth voice for each note in the matrix. I'm not sure how straight forward this part is...will find out. Update, I didn't do that part, saving for another day.

Let the abomination begin.

`r html_tag_audio("rando_1100.mp3", type = "wav")`

I used a nintendo sound font sound here. It's nice and random, too pretty though. Not nearly enough notes.

There are 128 possible notes and 15 bars. Each bar has four beats of 96 ticks. In total, there is 128 x 96 x 4 x 15 = 737280 cells where a note could be. I sampled about 1100 notes uniformly into those cells. That's just not enough. 

It should at least go to 11 percent, or about 81000 notes in 30 seconds. That seems like so many...oooooeeee.

HAHAHHAHAHA. Oh MY. Giving my eurorack a run on thick noise.

MuseScore4 would not render the sheet music for this. But, fluid synth didn't even blink.

**It's very loud, so beware.**

`r html_tag_audio("rando_B.mp3", type = "wav")`

Chunky compared to white noise, and whiffs of crystal rain.

## Notes

That was fun. Had to try it. Even though this is basically ridiculous, I might return here one day with some FX pedals.

----------------------------

I couldn't stay away. Too many questions. And, it seems like I could add program change notes to change the synth voice, so I'm going to try that. And, I wondered about ramping the note density up and down over time, and will try that too. Maybe some other stuff. 

## Randomizing notes and program changes

Based ona few checks of MIDI files, it seems I could insert a program change message anywhere in a track, and this ought to change the synth voice. Gotta try it out.

Notes:

- how many patches are in the nintendo sound font? need to find out.

Maybe run this? Seems to work and shows a long enough list to get me started.

```
echo "inst 1" | fluidsynth ~/Library/Audio/Sounds/Banks/nintendo_soundfont.sf2
```
Had to break out a while loop for this one!

Need to keep the program change between 0-127. I guess there would be other stuff to switch banks. Leaving that for now.

I got a lot of fluidsynth warnings for instrument not found when the PC value was 120 or greater. Oh well. This sounds like a breathy R2D2.

Here's another one using the `FluidR3_GM.sf2` soundfont, which is a General MIDI kind of thing. I set the note length to a bit longer.

Ha, I like it.

Meh...If I had a better handle on which patches I was randomizing over I bet that could sound more interesting.

Maybe I should write a utility function to play through the sounds really fast and check them out.

## Sweeping randomness up and down

If this was a eurorack module there would be a whole bunch of knobs to turn. I would turn a knob for note density, so let's see how easy it would be to have the randomness start with few notes, go up to ludicrous speed, and then come back down again.

And, program change all the notes, because why not.
