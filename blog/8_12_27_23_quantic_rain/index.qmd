#| echo: false
html_tag_audio <- function(file, type = c("wav")) {
  type <- match.arg(type)
  htmltools::tags$audio(
    controls = "",
    htmltools::tags$source(
      src = file,
      type = glue::glue("audio/{type}", type = type)
    )
  )
}

```

1. Record this thing into Ableton and grab the beat.

Sidenote. Attempting this on a new mac. I was going to record from Apple Music into Ableton, but I wasn't setup for that. I used to use soundflower to route audio, and now I'm going to try [loopback](https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/).

Really annoying to install on my new mac because of the process of allowing kernel extensions. ugh. Will it work? OK, it worked. 

2. Here's 8 bars from Quantic. The first 4 are a bit of cymabals, and the beat comes in on the last 4. It's the last 4 that I'm interested. 

`r html_tag_audio("main_beat.mp3", type = "wav")`

3. Set up some drums in Ableton and MIDIfy this beat.
  - This took a little while. Not a huge fan of penciling in midi markers on my computer to make beats.
  - Set up a basic drum rack, found some close enough sounds
  - Used the EP-133 as a midi controller to pound in the beats, that was more fun
  - Nudged things around etc.
  - got close
  
  
I ended up with this version of the main beat:

`r html_tag_audio("midi_100.mp3", type = "wav")`

Then, what's fun with having everything as a midi note is to play around with note probability, and with adding hits that weren't there, but now have a small probability of being there. Here's an example of setting most of the sounds to a 50% probability.

`r html_tag_audio("midi_50.mp3", type = "wav")`

It's more airy, but still carries the groove.

Practice notes: More or less accomplished the goal for this drum recreation exercise. Did not mix the drum voices to taste.

To Do:

- [] Use this somehow.
- [] Learn a little bit more about saving midi clips/audio etc. in ableton so that it is easy for me to re-use this later.
- [] See about programming this beat into the Varigate 8+, and or Hermod, so I have a modular version
