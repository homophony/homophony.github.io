I've been having some fun making short animations with Adobe After effects for the tracks on [Basement Tapes 1](https://homophony.quest/music/Basement_Tapes.html). I started with 7 second animations for the Spotify canvas format. These play in the background when a track is played on Spotify (on mobile I think?). Then more fun was had by lengthening them to 30 seconds for youtube shorts. See this playlist:

I figure I'll keep making these for some of the tracks on the older albums.

## VO: Country Fire

This morning I'm choosing [Country Fire from VO](https://homophony.quest/music/VO.html). It's a synthified country/blues song with heavy vocoder. There are periods of rambunctious bleep boops, which sound like a bunch of R2D2s on the prowl. 

As a quick aside, I jumped into "Apple music for artists", and took a quick look at their "promote" features, which produce little graphics like the one in the margin.

## Animation details

Feeding this prompt to dreamshaper-xl-turbo:

"R2D2 robots setting a country on fire. R2D2 everwhere. City scape. cartoon. neon bright sunset. 80s. linocut."

Then, the plan is to mangle these in Adobe after effects...let's see what happens.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| results: asis

#quick gallery
library(glue)

list_images_with_path <- list.files("images",full.names = T)
list_images<- list.files("images/")

cat("::: {layout-ncol=4}")
cat("\n","\n")
for(i in 1:8){
  gallery_name <- "my-gallery"
  im_name <- list_images[i]
  im_path <- list_images_with_path[i]
  cat(glue::glue('![{im_name}]({im_path}){{group="{gallery_name}"}}') , "\n" ,"\n")
}
cat(":::")

```


## Youtube Short

Very noisy and pixely! I blended through the above images and used the audio to bounce some of the vfx. R2D2s wreching havoc everywhere.
