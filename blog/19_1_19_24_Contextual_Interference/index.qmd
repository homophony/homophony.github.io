I've been having so much fun making time for more music. I so needed this.

As my next semester at Brooklyn College is about to begin next week, I'm hoping I can keep up some of this momentum. Coincidentally, this semester I am planning to turn some of my research program in cognitive psychology towards aspects of music cognition, and I ended up [posting about that a little bit on my main research blog yesterday](https://www.crumplab.com/blog/660_music_cognition/). The research won't necessarily mean playing more music, but it should at least keep me on my fingers, so to speak. 

Today's post continues in the spirit of intermingling my interests in cognition and piano practice. 

## Recap

Over the past few posts I've been focusing on getting command of the maj6 diminished scale in the key of B. [I measured my improvement with practice](https://homophony.quest/blog/18_1_18_24_Relearning/) and found a few things were happening. When I sit down to play the scale (I'm playing it as a series of chords ascending), there is a big start-up cost. On the first go round it took me 104 seconds to play the scale. Then a day later only about 60 seconds. Last night I started up at about 20 seconds. For each practice set, I also continued to produce the scale for 10 minutes, by playing it over and over, in what I might term massed repetitive practice. Within each practice set, my scale completion times decreased with each attempt. I usually got down to about 10 seconds to complete the scale. Still pretty slow, but making progress. 

I can play the 7th chords of a regular major scale in C in about 3 seconds, from a cold start. So, I'm using 3 seconds as a rough achievement criterion. If I can get my B maj6 diminished scale to 3 seconds, then I'll have achieved that somewhat arbitrary criterion. And, then I would literally be confident that I could play it in my sleep. I was trying to play it going to sleep in my head last night, and it is still slow to visualize.

I am definitely hitting a floor right now at about 10 seconds, and there could be several problems that I need to sort out. I don't often play in B, and it might be one of my weakest keys over all. Sometimes I get confused about whether I should be playing an E or F (yikes). The maj6 diminished scales adds a b6, and sometimes I get confused about that note (G). I don't know why I sometimes want to play A. I conceptually know the correct chords and fingerings, but can't execute everytime, especially with speed. So, in cognitive psychology terms, I am running up against the speed-accuracy tradeoff. I can go slow and accurate, but errors creep in approaching 10 seconds, and then they really popoff if I push past faster.

If I limit my musical goals to getting this one scale down, then I have so many questions about how to go about doing that. Overall, it is clear that I need to practice, practice, practice, and I will meet my fluency criterion eventually. But, there are lots of things to practice. I could practice the chords ascending only, which is how I'm measuring my performance. I could practice up and down, or arpeggios, and all sorts of other stuff. I could practice other scales. I could practice in lentghy repetitive sessions, or takes lots of breaks and practice every other day, or longer. Infinite practice variations here. 

Almost done with the recap. All of the above is about to connect to a phenomena in cognitive psychology called contextual interference. This phenomena shows that repeatedly practicing a motor sequence versus alternating practice between different motor sequences, can have notable consequences for learning, performance, and retention. And, I'd like to explore that with my own practice this morning. 

But, because I am full of tangents, I need to attempt an answer to a burning question first. 

How many practice attempts do I need to get my B maj6 diminished scale under 3 seconds?

## Estimating how much practice I need with my own practice curve

This graph shows my learning curves for three different sets of practice attempts. I start producing the scale slowly, and then as I repeatedly attempt the scale, I pick up speed until I get down to about 10 seconds. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
finishing_times_1 <- c(104,57,56,45,52,55,57,59,35,33,31,25,29,18,27,21)
sets_1 <- 1:length(finishing_times_1)

finishing_times_2 <- c(56,43,46,31,31,23,36,19,17,21,17,17,20,18,14,14,14,12,13,13,20,14,12,14,13,12,12,9,8)
sets_2 <- 1:length(finishing_times_2)

finishing_times_3 <- c(24,47,35,22,28,21,14,15,11,20,12,16,14,13,20,12,13,11,12,16,11,13,11,15,11,17,16,13,10,10,12,10,9,6,6,7)
sets_3 <- 1:length(finishing_times_3)

day <- c(rep("day_1", length(finishing_times_1)),
         rep("day_2", length(finishing_times_2)),
         rep("attempt_3", length(finishing_times_3))
         )

df <- tibble(day,
              finishing_times = c(finishing_times_1,
                                  finishing_times_2,
                                  finishing_times_3),
              sets = c(sets_1,
                       sets_2,
                       sets_3))

ggplot(df, aes(x=sets,y=finishing_times, color=day))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_line()+
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,105))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,110,10))+
  ylab("Scale finishing time (seconds)")+
  xlab("Practice Attempts")
```

What I can do next is take an average of these three learning curves, which looks like this:

```{r}

df_avg <- df %>%
  group_by(sets) %>%
  summarize(mean_ft = mean(finishing_times))

ggplot(df_avg, aes(x=sets,y=mean_ft))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_line()+
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,70))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,110,10))+
  ylab("Scale finishing time (seconds)")+
  xlab("Practice Attempts")

```

There is debate in the cognitive science literature about the functional form of this curve. Maybe it's a power function, maybe it's an exponential function. They are both pretty similar looking. Here's what a power function fit looks like:


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
finishing_times_1 <- c(104,57,56,45,52,55,57,59,35,33,31,25,29,18,27,21)
sets_1 <- 1:length(finishing_times_1)

finishing_times_2 <- c(56,43,46,31,31,23,36,19,17,21,17,17,20,18,14,14,14,12,13,13,20,14,12,14,13,12,12,9,8)
sets_2 <- 1:length(finishing_times_2)

finishing_times_3 <- c(24,47,35,22,28,21,14,15,11,20,12,16,14,13,20,12,13,11,12,16,11,13,11,15,11,17,16,13,10,10,12,10,9,6,6,7)
sets_3 <- 1:length(finishing_times_3)

day <- c(rep("day_1", length(finishing_times_1)),
         rep("day_2", length(finishing_times_2)),
         rep("attempt_3", length(finishing_times_3))
         )

df <- tibble(day,
              finishing_times = c(finishing_times_1,
                                  finishing_times_2,
                                  finishing_times_3),
              sets = c(sets_1,
                       sets_2,
                       sets_3))

df_avg <- df %>%
  group_by(sets) %>%
  summarize(mean_ft = mean(finishing_times))

model <- lm(log(mean_ft) ~ log(sets), data = df_avg)
summary(model)
fitted_values <- predict(model, newdata = data.frame(sets = 1:500),
                        interval = "prediction",
                        level = 0.95)


model_fits <- tibble(mean_ft = exp(fitted_values[,1]),
                     sets = 1:500)


ggplot(model_fits, aes(x=sets,y=mean_ft))+
  geom_line()+
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,70))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,110,10))+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,36))+
  ylab("Scale finishing time (seconds)")+
  xlab("Practice Attempts") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 213)+
  geom_point(aes(x=df_avg$sets[1:500], y = df_avg$mean_ft[1:500]))
```

Looks pretty good to me, the line is going right through dots. So, the line can represent a kind of average practice curve. The neat thing is that I can keep drawing the line out following the power function. This allows me to use my existing data to make a prediction about how many practice attempts I need to get down to 3 seconds.

```{r}
ggplot(model_fits, aes(x=sets,y=mean_ft))+
  geom_line()+
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,70))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,110,10))+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,250))+
  ylab("Scale finishing time (seconds)")+
  xlab("Practice Attempts") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 213)+
  geom_point(aes(x=df_avg$sets[1:500], y = df_avg$mean_ft[1:500]))
```

So, according to the limited data that I collected, I should be able to get down to 3 seconds in 219 practice attempts. If I add up all of the scale completion times from 1 to 219 (that are implied by this curve), then it will take 1568 seconds to get there, or 26 minutes of repeated practice. 

Wow, that surprises me actually, I thought it would take longer. And, this is only an estimate, it could be way off in either direction. For example, I've already practiced a total of 30 minutes, over 3 sets of 10 minutes. Maybe I should have tried 26 minutes the first time and just got it over with!

TBH I kind of want to go try this for 26 minutes as see what happens. Maybe I will set that aside as something I do later and report back. Instead, I will continue with the goal of this post.
