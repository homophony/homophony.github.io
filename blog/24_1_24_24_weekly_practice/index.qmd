Trying out a single post to record daily practice exercises that I will continue to update throughout a week. It's 1/24 and I will have to reconstruct what might have happened earlier this week.

## 1/21

- did a couple of chord reaction time tests
- got into the 7b5 chords a little bit, playing them in all keys very slowly

## 1/22

- Drilled 7b5 chords a bunch

## 1/23

- missed a day really oops
- played "all of me" a couple times

## 1/24

Major triads

Went through all of the below in all keys, anti-clockwise through circle of fifths

- play them once
- played the triad in right hand, with different bass notes from the triad
- played the triad up through keyboard through the inversions
- played the triad down through the inversions
- played the triad once, on the first inversion
- played the triad once, on the second inversion

I didn't make too many mistakes, but I was more rusty at this then I thought I would be. I'm still slow on Db and Ab. 

Starting on the different inversions is interesting. When I'm really into a jam, I don't think about what inversions to play and they just happen (on a good day). But, in this case, I'm not used to deliberately trying to play a specific triad in a specific inversion. Playing the second inversion was hardest for some reason.
