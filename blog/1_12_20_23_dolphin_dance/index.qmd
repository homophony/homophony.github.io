Have been messing about with Herbie Hancock's "Dolphin Dance" on the piano for a while.

Had a clear day to try some mixer mimicking. Plan was to develop my own voicings for everything, but mix them similar to the Maiden Voyage recording...and then jam it.

What happened:

-   Recorded the Hancock version into Ableton
-   Located BPM
-   Voices
    -   Rhodes
    -   Moog matriarch bass lines
    -   MPC drums
    -   OB-6 horns
-   For each voice, play with the original record. Keep recording in a loop using Ableton comping lanes
-   Fix messes by sampling in comping lanes/ explore have fun with fixing the mess
-   Duplicate the head, then solo overtop for a bit
-   Mix it down.
-   Try some final mixing touches.
