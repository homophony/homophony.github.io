Yet another quick post on making an animation for an older track. 

## VO: Every Station Needs Command

This one is [Every Station Needs Command from VO](https://homophony.quest/music/VO.html). It's a bit alternative indie rock synth downtempo thing? 

## Animation details

I put in this prompt, "Space station universe situation. Synthesizer universe. Neon. 80s Cartoon. Thundercats. Command station." to dreamshaper-turbo-xl.

This time I have a plan for what I want to do in adobe after effects. Most likely I will pick one of these pictures. Then, I'll load it into AE. The vision is a series of circles, rotating in alternating directions, potentially bouncing a little bit to the beat. I'll fill the circles with the picture. It will start with the picture as normal, then the picture, which will be composed of a series of lined up concentric circles, will rotate away from itself as the circles spin around, and then back to it's starting position. Or something like that.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| results: asis

#quick gallery
library(glue)

list_images_with_path <- list.files("images",full.names = T)
list_images<- list.files("images/")

cat("::: {layout-ncol=4}")
cat("\n","\n")
for(i in 1:8){
  gallery_name <- "my-gallery"
  im_name <- list_images[i]
  im_path <- list_images_with_path[i]
  cat(glue::glue('![{im_name}]({im_path}){{group="{gallery_name}"}}') , "\n" ,"\n")
}
cat(":::")

```


## Youtube Short

A couple spinning circles inside a command station.
