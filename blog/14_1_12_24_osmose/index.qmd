I've been really curious about the [Expressive Osmose](https://www.expressivee.com/2-osmose) keyboard for a while now. So, I picked one up yesterday.

Basically all I have to say is: HOLY WOW.

I might have more to say later, and I may add notes to this post about the osmose as I go through the [7 stages of osmose ownership](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y02SCLQSnzw).

For, now I need to get back to pitch bending every note into a tornado of meowing cats.
