Matt Crump is a cognitive psychologist with research interests in learning, memory, attention, skill learning, semantics, and computational modeling. He runs the computational cognition lab at Brooklyn College of CUNY. He also plays music.

Homophony is a word created by Richard Semon as a part of his theory of memory processes. It refers to the concept that experiences in memory may resonate with one another, like notes on a piano.
