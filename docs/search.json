    "text": "“An underground lair of piano playing rabbits. Above the rabbits are the roots of carrots that have been eaten by rabbits as they play piano.” - LCM_Dreamshaper_v7\nToday’s exercise was running I∆7add9 chords through the circle of fifths.\nThe first row shows the notes of the C major scale with corresponding numbers. The 9th note is the same as the second note in the scale.\nThe second row shows the concept of constructing chords from thirds. From this perspective, you get all of the notes in the scale going up by thirds, but the 9th, 11th, and 13th note are out of their normal order.\nThis exercise focuses on the “rootless” 9th chord on the bottom row. That one has a major 3rd, a perfect fifth, a major 7th, and a 9th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n\n\n\n\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nA\nB\n\n\nC\n\nE\n\nG\n\nB\n\nD\n\nF\n\nA\n\n\n\n\n\nE\n\nG\n\nB\n\nD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the exercise I played these chords clockwise and anti-clockwise through the circle of fifths. I usually used my left hand for the bass note and to remind myself where I was in the circle. Then I played versions of the 9th chord. They all have a smashing pumpkins kind of vibe.\nOne reason I chose this exercise is to press harder on deprogramming my root conditioning. These chords don’t have the root in them, so they must be good for that (e.g., thinking about doing something in C, but not playing C, or only playing around C).\nAnother musical connection is that these 9th chords are the same as a III-7 chord. So, an E minor 7th is a C major 7th add 9.\nCognitive science connections: As a sidenote, my day job is a cognitive psychology professor who studies skill-learning. I’ve been meaning to do some piano skill research and I even have the keyboards in my lab to do it. So, as I go through these exercises it’s been fun thinking about issues like how does training on some musical ideas transfer to others.\nFor example, I’m already fairly fluid at playing the circle of fifths in different ways. If I’m playing single notes, I can go through the circle very quickly. It’s slower for chords, but still fairly quick. I’ve been practicing my 7th chords through the circle, so I can already go through the circle playing minor 7th chords fairly quickly. However, it turns out I can not do these 9th chords quickly. There should be pretty good transfer here because the 9th chords are exactly the same as the minor 7th chords that I have already practiced.\nIn terms of minor 7th chords I had been practicing these chords, with the root in the bass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\n\n\n\nE-7\nB-7\nGb-7\nDb-7\nAb-7\nEb-7\nBb-7\nF-7\nC-7\nG-7\nD-7\nA-7\n\n\nE\nB\nGb\nDb\nAb\nEb\nBb\nF\nC\nG\nD\nA\n\n\n\nBut, I had not been practicing those chords with the following bass notes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\n\n\n\nE-7\nB-7\nGb-7\nDb-7\nAb-7\nEb-7\nBb-7\nF-7\nC-7\nG-7\nD-7\nA-7\n\n\nC\nG\nD\nA\nE\nB\nGb\nDb\nAb\nEb\nBb\nF\n\n\n\nGeneralization is so fickle sometimes.\nAlso, I have some super-biased thirds. What’s the third of C -&gt; E. No problem, that’s fast. A -&gt; C, G -&gt; B. But, B ———&gt; Eb. That one hurts. Eb seems too far away to be a third. In any case. I need to flatten out this distribution at some point."

    "text": "“A small penguin wearing headphones. The penguin listens to the music from the headphones. The penguin sits in front of a piano. The penguin can imagine the musical notes in a tornado above her head.” - LCM_Dreamshaper_v7\nI spent most of yesterday working through Wynton Kelly’s solo on Freddie Freeloader (from Miles Davis’s Kind of Blue). My plan for this post is to talk a little bit about what I did, and what I learned.\nA slight detour though. It’s been very nice to have some clear time to actually practice piano, let alone enough time to break down a solo. When I was a kid the advice was to listen to recordings and learn to play from them by ear. In some cases I was able to do this (with difficulty, because I didn’t spend enough time practicing this way), but for the most part I didn’t have the recordings to listen to. Flash-forward to today and almost everything is available to stream. That’s amazing when you’re trying to learn something by ear. Not only that, but the internet is full of musicians sharing their practice tips. It’s almost overwhelming, but in a good way.\nFor Freddie Freeloader I checked out a couple of YouTube videos before trying the solo myself: a transcription video and an analysis video. Then I played the song a couple times before heading downstairs. Here’s the breakdown process I used this time.\n\nPlay the original recording into a track on Ableton live\nCut the track so that it starts properly on the first bar\nTurn off “warp”, and then adjust the tempo of Ableton until the beats in the track line up properly with the bars in Ableton.\n\n\nThe purple track is the original recording. The selected area is the first two bars, and it is possible to loop the selection and/or slow it down without changing the pitch (by turning warp back on).\nI wasn’t particularly interested in learning the solo to play it note for note straight through. But, I was interested in trying out each little part and thinking about how the notes were used as phrases.\nSo, I worked in sections of two bars, looped each section, then played over top on the Fender Rhodes until I thought I had the line. The blue track are my 2 bar recordings on the Rhodes.\nI didn’t have time to get through the whole solo, just the first 12 bars, and it got a little messy at the end. Oh well. Had lots of fun.\n  \nPractice notes: I ended up practicing the first phrase through the circle of fifths this morning."

It’s been a little bit painful because I am so out of practice. Perhaps there is a new year’s resolution here to practice more. But, what to practice?\nMy recent routine is working through the circle of fifths and reclaiming some basics.\n\nPlaying Maj7 chords anti-clockwise and then clockwise through the circle of fifths\nPlaying II-V-I through the circle of fifths\nPlaying V7-V7 through the circle of fifths\nPlaying I-VI-II-V through the circle of fifths. This is the same progression as in “Heart and Soul”, a duet we’d play as kids. Currently, I’m asking the question whether I can play this song effortlessly (chords in the left hand, melody in the right) in a key as I go around the circle, and if the answer is yes, I shouldn’t practice this key, and if the answer is no, then I should.\n\nStarting to get some fluency back. I was never that diligent at practicing through all of the keys, and some of them need a lot of work.\nIdeally, I’d like to keep a little journal here of practice strategies, reporting on: what I’m doing, what I’m hoping to get out of it (or did get out of it), and other observations that could relate to musical connections and/or connections to the cognitive science of skill learning."

Did this multiple times with each inversion.\nNoted that I liked the sound of the 3rd inversion the best. Ran up and down enough times that I could play fairly fluently, almost into melody territory. Will likely continue this sort of practice across other keys.\n\nAside…I’ve been messing around with huggingface models as a possible way to generate visual stimuli for some experiments this semester. The class of latent consistency models can generate decent images fairly quickly. This morning I downloaded the “dreamshaper-xl-turbo” model to test it out. Today’s blog picture was generated from this model."

    "text": "The basic task is to play Major 7th chords through the circle of fifths.\n\n\nCircle of fifths\nGoing clockwise the next note is a perfect fifth from the previous note.\n\nMajor 7th chords have a I-III-V-maj7 structure. These are the first, third, fifth, and major 7th notes in the major scale of the root key. For example, the key of C has 7 notes in the major scale: C D E F G A B\nThe chord C Maj7 (also notated as C∆7) is C-E-G-B.\nWhere C is the root or first note, E is the III, G is the V, and B is the major VII. The same pattern is applied to make Maj7 chords in all other keys.\nAt the beginning of this practice track I play chords going anti-clockwise through the circle of fifths:\nC∆7 - F∆7 - Bb∆7 - Eb∆7 - Ab∆7 - Db∆7 - Gb∆7 - B∆7 - E∆7 - A∆7 - D∆7 - G∆7 - C∆7\nI can probably play through this a bit faster, but not without making mistakes. One goal is to get the speed up both in both directions (anti-clockwise and clockwise).\nNext, there is a short riff that I got from Nahre Sol’s youtube channel, who has some other great recommendations for playing through maj7th chords.\nThen, I end with playing ∆7th chords in my left hand and messing around with playing through major scales in the right hand. For example, if I’m playing a C∆7th, then I’m playing through the C major scale and so on. I thought I would have a better grasp on all of the major scales, but some of them are way out of practice. Yeesh. Baby steps.\nA random observation about musical relationships that this exercise drew out. When playing anti-clockwise, the next chord remains ambiguous with respect to the tonal center: it could indicate a switch of the root, but maybe not. There isn’t enough evidence to go on based on the notes in the major 7th chords.\nFor example, going from C∆7 to F∆7 involves CEGB and FACE, all of these notes are in the C Major scale. So, the F∆7 chord doesn’t add any new notes, which in my mind allows some ambiguity about whether we are in C major still or have switched to F major. The F major scale has a Bb, which is the one note that makes F major different from C major, but this note is not voiced in the F∆7 chord. However, this “new note”, which would provide evidence that the root had switched from C to F is voiced by the next chord in the circle of fifths, Bb. So, in some sense moving anti-clockwise by one chord sets up a question—has the root changed?—and moving one more chord answers the question—yes—, but also asks the same question again, in a circle of fifths."

    "text": "I’ve been taking practice inspiration from Mark Levine’s Jazz Theory Book. This exercise wasn’t in there specifically, but it’s in the spirit of root-bias deprogramming.\n\n\n\nLevine has these fun quips throughout that I’m trying to follow through on:\n\nRemember, practice all scales and patterns both ascending and descending; on the major, melodic minor, diminished, and whole-tone scales and in all keys\n\n\nYou’ve now learned about all four of the scales you’ll need under your fingers to play over chord changes. The next question is how to practice them. And you don’t just want to practice them, but to internalize them to the point where they become an available pool of notes, on which to improvise.\n\n\n…the goal is to deprogram yourself from years of root-bias conditioning\n\nI learned piano in the classical music tradition and practiced all my scales and chords in a massively root-biased way when I was a kid. So, one of my goals right now is to think about chords from non-root perspectives.\nFor example, in this exercise my goal is to practice leading with the 7th note. This is related to the exercise from yesterday, but I did few things differently. Here’s the idea:\n\n\nPlay II-V-I chords through the circle of fifths\nFor each chord, lead with the 7th note, then bounce between the 7th note and each inversion of the 7th chord.\n\nIn the first bar I have a D-7 chord in the key of C major. The minor 7th note is a C, and instead of thinking C = C major, I’m trying to also think C = D-7 . And, by doing this around the circle of fifths, you end up practicing every kind of 7th chord (maj, dom, min) for every key.\nThis exercise implies some related ones that I’ll get to some other day, such as leading with the 5th, or leading with the 3rd…and then leading with the weirder stuff (sus, b5, b9, #11)."

I have been noodling away roughly alphabetically through the 500 presets. I’m just starting the ones that begin with C. It’s easy to get lost in fun for hours doing this.

    "text": "Velocity and pressure\nThe osmose has several dimensions of expressive control. Like most standard midi keyboards it has note velocity, but it also has pressure, aftertouch, and pitch bend for each key independently, with 24 voice polyphony!\n\n\n\nA digression into my past life of utterly not liking midi keyboards. I grew up playing a Roland 5600 with a MC-300 (or 500?) and MT-32 (where much was had with the orchestra hit sound). I would go to my piano teacher’s houses for lessons on a real piano, and practice on the midi piano at home. It was fun to make different sounds on the roland, but I always wanted a real piano as a kid.\nI still love the action of a real piano. It turns out I also love the action of my rhodes 88 key electric piano. But, I have never loved the action of any midi keyboard that I have ever owned or played. Not the hammer action ones. Not any of them.\nIn 2019 I got to play a CS-80 one time in Melbourne and I could not believe how much a difference polyphonic aftertouch made. It’s so sad that midi keyboards suck so much for so long.\nMaybe I didn’t spend enough time with the other midi keyboards that I didn’t like. Most recently I brought home a Nord 88 key stage piano to use a controller, and it was just ok…one key broke, and there is an uncurable noisy power supply. Plus, these things never feel like an instrument to me, so they just constantly suck joy.\nI have tried to adjust velocity curves and find something that seems better, but never got there. It’s possible I just don’t like how velocity is usually implemented, or that velocity is missing something for me. In any case, when I play on my acoustic or electric piano, even though both keyboards have very different action, they are both very playable and immediately expressive. I don’t have think about it, the expression is just there.\nThis is what I now adore about the osmose. The expression is right there at my finger tips.\nI really like that they have pressure per key too."

    "text": "Squishy goodness\nIt’s hard to describe what the action feels like. There is some initial resistance to the keys, but not too much. This is great for light and/or bouncy tapping and slowly applying pressure to the keys. Many of the presets make sound from pressure alone, and sometimes different sounds from pressure or velocity.\nThe aftertouch is the best feeling aftertouch I’ve ever played. There is a slight difference in resistance when you get to aftertouch land, and way more travel down into the aftertouch than on typical midi keyboards. It feels like the key keeps going down into it’s aftertouch home, where it belongs sometimes.\nSimilarly, the key’s pick up side-to-side wiggling throughout the travel of the key and into aftertouch range. This parameter is usually applied to pitch bend. It get’s a bit easier to wiggle when the key is pressed down a bit, but over all it’s very natural."
