    "text": "Modes as known knowns\nI’m not sure when I first learned about modes, but probably some time in middle school. Since then I have– in a definitional sense– known what they were.\nThe way I encoded them as a piano player was in terms of the C major scale. There are 7 modes of the major scale, corresponding to each key of the major scale. Each mode involves playing the major scale from a different root note. This got turned into a heuristic like, play all the white keys from C to C…then play them from D to D, E to E, and so on. Those are the modes. That’s it. Also, the major scale modes have these Greek names:\n\n\n\nMode Name\nStarting Note\nNotes in C Major\n\n\n\n\nIonian\nI\nCDEFGABC\n\n\nDorian\nII\nDEFGACBD\n\n\nPhrygian\nIII\nEFGABCDE\n\n\nLydian\nIV\nFGABCDEF\n\n\nMixolydian\nV\nGABCDEFG\n\n\nAeolian\nVI\nABCDEFGA\n\n\nLocrian\nVII\nBCDEFGAB\n\n\n\nThe mode concept is a descriptive one. Other scales have can be described as having modes using the same principles as above.\nThat’s about as far the known knowns go for me. I don’t really think in terms of modes when I play. Also, that’s why I’m working on thinking in terms of modes again. For the extra flavor and different perspective that they bring."

    "text": "Modes as known unknowns\nThere’s lots of other stuff that I in some sense “know” about modes. But, in practice, that conceptual knowledge is not well integrated into my playing.\nThe best example is that I never really bothered to automatize the modes across all of the keys. Oops. Here again is a strange failure of generalization.\nOn the one hand, I have practiced all of the modes across all of the keys. For example, over the past month I’ve been doing a lot of major scale work going up and down the major scale in every key, in every mode. I can play them all reasonably quickly now. So, that’s great. I must know my modes right? Not really.\nOn the other hand, I wasn’t thinking about modes, mode names, or modal relationships as I was playing through those scales. So, for example, I knew it would be hard to play C scales in the different modes. Of course I know C ionian. But, what is C dorian? Mind goes blank. Then slowly, “yes, C is the II of Bb”, so then C dorian is, “play a Bb major scale starting from C.” Then, what is the third mode even? Can’t remember…oh yes, Phrygian. What is C Phrygian? ummm….blah.\nOf course, I can play an Ab major scale, but thinking of C Phygrian as Ab is one of those known unknowns. It’s the kind of missing connections I know are there, but haven’t bothered to glue together.\nMore generally, I’m hoping that working through modes will help me firm up these kinds of relations between notes so that they are within striking distance of my finger tips. For example:\n\nC as a I (Ionian) in C\nC as a II (dorian) in Bb\nC as a III (phrygian) in Ab\nC as a IV (Lydian) in G\nC as a V (Mixolydian) in F\nC as a VI (Aeolian) in Eb\nC as a VII (Locrian) in Db\n\nAnd, then all of those same relationships for every note."

For example, let’s say you play a C and G, which could be described as a perfect fifth in the key of C. What else could it be? Those notes are in the C major scale, so they could imply C Ionian. Those notes are also in the Bb major scale (the II and VI), so they could imply Bb as the tonal center, and in that case playing notes from C dorian would help fill in that implication. The same goes for all of the other modes of C (except for locrian where the G is diminished). And this is a fun little toy to play with, like a jack-in-the-box. Playing Cs and Gs is like turning the gear of the box, building expectations about what kind of jack will pop up, and then OMG, it’s a locrian scale."

    "text": "Modes as slash/polychords\nI’ve seen different definitions of slash and polychords. One definition of a slash chord (say D/F#) is to play the numerator triad (D) with the denominator bass note (F#). And, a polychord would be playing one triad with the right hand (D) and another with the left hand (F#).\nAnother way to think of playing modes is in terms of slash chords or poly chords; or, I guess slash scales or poly scales. For example, consider a G/C. That could indicate a G major scale over a C bass note. Playing the G major scale starting and ending on C is the same as C lydian.\nIn the next table the note in the denominator is the root. The note in the numerator is the major scale to be played over the root (starting and ending on the root). The roman numerals show interval relations between the root and scale. For example, in the lydian column, the root is the fourth note in the corresponding scale (C is the fourth of G, G is the fourth of C). Modifying the major scale in the denominator by the accidental yields the major scale in the numerator (For Bb/C, flattening the 37 in C is B-&gt; Bb and E -&gt; Eb, which then turns the C scale into a Bb scale).

Like most standard midi keyboards it has note velocity, but it also has pressure, aftertouch, and pitch bend for each key independently, with 24 voice polyphony!\n\n\n\nA digression into my past life of utterly not liking midi keyboards. I grew up playing a Roland 5600 with a MC-300 (or 500?) and MT-32 (where much was had with the orchestra hit sound). I would go to my piano teacher’s houses for lessons on a real piano, and practice on the midi piano at home. It was fun to make different sounds on the roland, but I always wanted a real piano as a kid.\nI still love the action of a real piano. It turns out I also love the action of my rhodes 88 key electric piano. But, I have never loved the action of any midi keyboard that I have ever owned or played. Not the hammer action ones. Not any of them.\nIn 2019 I got to play a CS-80 one time in Melbourne and I could not believe how much a difference polyphonic aftertouch made. It’s so sad that midi keyboards suck so much for so long.\nMaybe I didn’t spend enough time with the other midi keyboards that I didn’t like. Most recently I brought home a Nord 88 key stage piano to use a controller, and it was just ok…one key broke, and there is an uncurable noisy power supply. Plus, these things never feel like an instrument to me, so they just constantly suck joy.\nI have tried to adjust velocity curves and find something that seems better, but never got there. It’s possible I just don’t like how velocity is usually implemented, or that velocity is missing something for me. In any case, when I play on my acoustic or electric piano, even though both keyboards have very different action, they are both very playable and immediately expressive. I don’t have think about it, the expression is just there.\nThis is what I now adore about the osmose. The expression is right there at my finger tips.\nI really like that they have pressure per key too."

This is great for light and/or bouncy tapping and slowly applying pressure to the keys. Many of the presets make sound from pressure alone, and sometimes different sounds from pressure or velocity.\nThe aftertouch is the best feeling aftertouch I’ve ever played. There is a slight difference in resistance when you get to aftertouch land, and way more travel down into the aftertouch than on typical midi keyboards. It feels like the key keeps going down into it’s aftertouch home, where it belongs sometimes.\nSimilarly, the key’s pick up side-to-side wiggling throughout the travel of the key and into aftertouch range. This parameter is usually applied to pitch bend. It get’s a bit easier to wiggle when the key is pressed down a bit, but over all it’s very natural."

The next question is how to practice them. And you don’t just want to practice them, but to internalize them to the point where they become an available pool of notes, on which to improvise.\n\n\n…the goal is to deprogram yourself from years of root-bias conditioning\n\nI learned piano in the classical music tradition and practiced all my scales and chords in a massively root-biased way when I was a kid. So, one of my goals right now is to think about chords from non-root perspectives.\nFor example, in this exercise my goal is to practice leading with the 7th note. This is related to the exercise from yesterday, but I did few things differently. Here’s the idea:\n\n\nPlay II-V-I chords through the circle of fifths\nFor each chord, lead with the 7th note, then bounce between the 7th note and each inversion of the 7th chord.\n\nIn the first bar I have a D-7 chord in the key of C major. The minor 7th note is a C, and instead of thinking C = C major, I’m trying to also think C = D-7 . And, by doing this around the circle of fifths, you end up practicing every kind of 7th chord (maj, dom, min) for every key.\nThis exercise implies some related ones that I’ll get to some other day, such as leading with the 5th, or leading with the 3rd…and then leading with the weirder stuff (sus, b5, b9, #11)."

    "text": "The basic task is to play Major 7th chords through the circle of fifths.\n\n\nCircle of fifths\nGoing clockwise the next note is a perfect fifth from the previous note.\n\nMajor 7th chords have a I-III-V-maj7 structure. These are the first, third, fifth, and major 7th notes in the major scale of the root key. For example, the key of C has 7 notes in the major scale: C D E F G A B\nThe chord C Maj7 (also notated as C∆7) is C-E-G-B.\nWhere C is the root or first note, E is the III, G is the V, and B is the major VII. The same pattern is applied to make Maj7 chords in all other keys.\nAt the beginning of this practice track I play chords going anti-clockwise through the circle of fifths:\nC∆7 - F∆7 - Bb∆7 - Eb∆7 - Ab∆7 - Db∆7 - Gb∆7 - B∆7 - E∆7 - A∆7 - D∆7 - G∆7 - C∆7\nI can probably play through this a bit faster, but not without making mistakes. One goal is to get the speed up both in both directions (anti-clockwise and clockwise).\nNext, there is a short riff that I got from Nahre Sol’s youtube channel, who has some other great recommendations for playing through maj7th chords.\nThen, I end with playing ∆7th chords in my left hand and messing around with playing through major scales in the right hand. For example, if I’m playing a C∆7th, then I’m playing through the C major scale and so on. I thought I would have a better grasp on all of the major scales, but some of them are way out of practice. Yeesh. Baby steps.\nA random observation about musical relationships that this exercise drew out. When playing anti-clockwise, the next chord remains ambiguous with respect to the tonal center: it could indicate a switch of the root, but maybe not. There isn’t enough evidence to go on based on the notes in the major 7th chords.\nFor example, going from C∆7 to F∆7 involves CEGB and FACE, all of these notes are in the C Major scale. So, the F∆7 chord doesn’t add any new notes, which in my mind allows some ambiguity about whether we are in C major still or have switched to F major. The F major scale has a Bb, which is the one note that makes F major different from C major, but this note is not voiced in the F∆7 chord. However, this “new note”, which would provide evidence that the root had switched from C to F is voiced by the next chord in the circle of fifths, Bb. So, in some sense moving anti-clockwise by one chord sets up a question—has the root changed?—and moving one more chord answers the question—yes—, but also asks the same question again, in a circle of fifths."

Easing back into practice.\n\nPlayed through each scale using 7ths chords going anti-clockwise through the circle of fifths.\n\nI’ve overplayed the C major scale for decades and should probably just stop practicing in C. At the same time, I can rip through the C major scale using 7th chords very quickly. In addition to practice, it seems easier to “see” the 7th chords in C major– they all have the same shape and use only white keys. It would be nice to have that immediacy for all of the other scales, and this is something I’m slowly working towards.\n\nDid a little bit of focused practice in G. Played through the G Major scale using 7th chords to build up speed. Played up and down using each inversion of each 7th chord."

    "section": "Explanatory and descriptive theory",
    "text": "Explanatory and descriptive theory\nThe title of this post is transitions. Mostly, I want to focus this on changes from one musical element to another. Before I head in that direction, I’ve been mulling over a more theoretical transition that has been helpful. My own mental transition from thinking about music theory as explanatory versus descriptive.\nWhen I was first learning music theory (Royal Conservatory of Music, Canadian styles) I was a kid and didn’t have a wide exposure to different ways of thinking about music or theory in general. I remember working through music theory exercise books as homework. I don’t remember what was in those books necessarily, but probably they gave me a lot of basic names and definitions for musical elements.\nIn high school and early undergrad years I was still playing music when I could, and was getting much more heavily into jazz and improvising. I was also learning more about science, philosophy of science, and cognitive psychology, which shaped a general interest in theory. My day job is now as a cognitive psychology prof, and after many years of that job, the topic of theory still holds my interest. For example, in cognitive psychology a common goal is to develop theories that “explain” some phenomena of interest. Given the complexity of human/animal cognition, explaining how something works is usually a very tall order. This also raises the question of what gets to count as a successful explanation. Mechanistic theories are often held in high regard, as they would describe how individual components of some system work together to produce the phenomena of interest. Here, a phenomena is “explained” in terms of the way that it’s component pieces/processes work together.\nWhen I became interested in learning “jazz” chords I was also scrambling to connect what I was learning back to music theory concepts I had been taught growing up. I can’t remember what my piano teachers had told me about what kind of “theory” music theory was supposed to be…I’m not sure that issue ever came up. Looking back, there were definitely a few years where I thought that music theory was somehow “explanatory”. For example, I would be analyzing a lead sheet trying to use music theory concepts to “understand” and “explain” why the melody went from here to there, or why the chord changed from this to that. Although sizeable chunks of a given song could be readily described using music theory concepts I had learned, there would be lots of changes that didn’t make sense to me. Sometimes a particularly inexplicable change would lead to hours of pondering possible contortions of music theory that might explain why something sounded good or made sense. I’ll give an example soon, but this is all to say that I was frustrated by looking toward music theory for explanation.\nAt that time I think I was missing the concept of “descriptive theory”. In cognitive science there are lots of examples of researchers using descriptive theories. Many of theses example derive from a logical positivist approach to science. Here, a primary goal is to predict and control a phenomena of interest. A common strategy is to create a descriptive system that can provide names for elements of a system, and mathematical functions to relate how elements move together or interact with one another. If a system can be well described using mathematical functions then it can be predicted and controlled. In this framework, the correspondence between reality and the descriptive system matters less than the amount of prediction and control achieved by the system. I’m getting too caught up here, and need to get back on track so I can practice more piano.\nHere’s a point I have been slowly internalizing. Music theory provides a systematic way of describing some musical elements. But, it’s a descriptive theory, not an explanatory theory. Music theory doesn’t explain many important aspects of music. For example, it doesn’t explain how feelings of tension and resolution and created by musical elements. Music theory is not very generative. I may understand the C major scale, and the modes, and the chords that come from the C major scale, but this understanding does not show me how to compose any given song with C as a tonal center.\nAt least in my experience (and I don’t have an advanced degree in music theory), music theory is less of a theory and more of a naming convention system, rather than a fully worked out descriptive theory that a logical positivist would be proud of. Potato, tomato.\n\n\n\nWhereas earlier I would go down “beautiful mind” rabbit holes trying to “explain” a lead sheet from a music theory point of view, now I’m much more content for music theory to be the exceptional descriptive system that it is. Exceptional in the sense that exceptions are used whenever they are needed. And, that’s just the way it is.\n\nAlice in wonderland\nHere’s an example of the rabbit holes I go down from “Alice in Wonderland”. And, maybe it would all “make sense” if only I knew more music theory 🤷.\n\nThe first seven chords follow a similar pattern, and there is more than one way to describe it. I used the blue pen to show the pattern in terms of leading 7ths being resolved to thirds in the next chord. For example, the first chord change is from D-7 to G7. In D-7, C is the 7th note, which moves down one semitone to a B, or major third in G7. In G7, F is the 7th note, which moves down one semitone to an E, or major third of C∆7.\nAspects of this pattern repeat until it starts breaking. The transition between B-7b5 and E7 is a little bit exceptional. Up until this point all of the notes are in the C major scale. If I was focusing on music theory as explanation I would ask, “what is G# doing in there?”. It sort of fits the pattern in that the 7th of of B-7b5 (A) is resolved to the third of E7 (G#). But, the pattern really breaks when going from A-7 to Eb7. Now, the 7th of A-7 (G) is repeated as the third in Eb7 (G), and all of the other notes in Eb7 (Eb Bb Db) are not in C major. There is also some interesting symmetry in the exceptions. The -iii7 chord in C is E-7, or EGBD. The E7 chord is close, and it sharpens the third EG#BD. Similarly, the Eb7 chord is close, but it keeps the G, and flattens the other notes, EbGBbDb. A kind of chordal call and response in terms of playing with exceptions to the C major scale.\nIt’s also possible to describe the chord changes from other perspectives. For example, instead of 7ths to 3rds, the pattern is also 1sts to 5ths. The root in D-7 becomes the fifth in G7. The root in G7 becomes the fifth in C∆7, and so on. This keeps repeating until the root in A-7 becomes a Bb in Eb7, which I guess is close enough.\nMy younger, and even older self on occasion, would get flustered by the Eb7, and consider questions like, “what music theory concepts make sense of these exceptions?”. It’s a fun question kind of question to ponder, but I’m more aware now of not getting too lost in pondering for too long.\nNow it’s flavor over explanation every time.\n\n\nCocktail music\nMusic is more like mixing cocktails. It should taste good and be interesting. I’m no mixologist, but I’ll mix up a Negroni once in a while with 1 part gin, 1 part vermouth, and 1 part campari. This cocktail is amenable to lots of variations. Switch the gin to bourbon for a boulevardier. Add a twist. Play with the ratios. Add little bits of more stuff for extra fun.\nWith the cocktail metaphor we can have an almost useless generic descriptive theory of cocktails. Cocktails are composed of multiple component parts, usually liquids, but not always, in particular ratios to each other. This kind of theory isn’t useful for making any cocktails. It can be useful to describe a cocktail using the system and then notice elements that might be analogized to other cocktails. For example, a negroni is 3 equal parts with lots of options for substitutions, implying a whole family of negroni-like drinks. So, the system could be used to explore negroni-style drinks by switching out pieces, trying different amaros instead of campari, etc. And, by giving names to components of cocktails, similarities may appear to arise between cocktails based on the collections of components. For example, the Manhattan is 2 parts bourbon 1 part red vermouth. It’s like a boulevardier, but substituting campari for more whiskey. In any case, I don’t need cocktails to make sense, they just need to taste good. And, they often taste exceptional when they contain some random stuff from left field that I never expected.\nSo, with music, the mood is to trod around in places that seem to have nice regular structure, and then throw in the good tasty flavors as much as possible.\nAnd, now to the thing I actually wanted to write about."

    "text": "Transitions and movement\nThis should probably be a second post, but the above is a preface on transitions. I actually failed to state one of the main points I intended to make in the above discussion—perspective does make things seem different. Even though music theory is more of a descriptive than explanatory theory, the descriptions change perspective, even if they are describing the same thing. For example, a D-7 chord invokes certain concepts for me. It’s the -ii in C major. It’s D Dorian. It sounds a certain way, etc. That same chord in the 1st inversion is FACD, which is also an Fmaj6 chord that invites a different set of musical ideas. As a sidenote, it would be interesting to discuss these perspective shifts a bit further from a cognitive psychology perspective (e.g., in terms of the associative fan effect, and other phenomena).\nNow, onto the main post.\nOn review, much of the exercises I have been working on lately are “noun” focused. I’ve been working on chords and modes mostly in the major scale, and trying to get all of that stuff more accessible to my fingers when I am playing. I could also call this “object” focused, where I’m trying to increase the fluency in my object production, where the objects are chords or scales. I’m getting better, so that’s good.\nBut, a question is looming that I have not been very actively addressing. These are questions about movement and transition. If I am here…where do I go from here. Where is there?\nI need to start shifting my exercise into a verb focus, where I’m taking actions with musical elements, rather than just being a finger factory that produces musical doo-dads with high fluency for no reason.\nEnter dominant chords, piano YouTube, and Barry Harris.\nI’m not sure how organized the next stuff will be. Mostly a scratch pad."

    "text": "Fully diminished chords and more\nI feel confident that I learned important things about fully diminished 7th chords when I was younger. But, I completely forget about them until yesterday when I started watching Shan Verma discussing Alice in Wonderland on youtube.\nThis quickly led to a series of rabbit holes about fully diminished 7th chords, Barry Harris and his system, and the major 6th diminished scale.\nBut, before I get to that. I need to go make lunch.\n\nLunch break is over. Now, my goal is to put down some breadcrumbs and then get back to the piano.\n\nBreadcrumb 1 - Fully Diminished 7th chords\nThese are composed of entirely of minor 3rds. So, a fully diminished Cbb7 is CEbGbA.\nRandomly came across this series of observations about using these chords for transitions\nThere are only three different versions of this chord–C, Db and D–as the inversions cover all of the roots.\nThey are very useful for transitions.\nMoving any note down a semitone turns the chord into a dominant 7th chord. Very useful for modulation.\n\n\nBreadcrumb 2 - major 6th diminished scale\nThis scale has 8 notes, adding a flat 6 to the major scale\nC D E F G A Ab B\n\n\nBreadcrumb 3 - Barry Harris’s system\nI haven’t had enough to time to learn what this whole system is. So far, I have just watched one youtube video from Shan Verma on this.\nThe trail of breadcrumbs started at the beginning of his Alice in Wonderland analysis video. In that video he played alternating inversions of maj6 and fully diminished chords, and that immediately clicked something for me.\nThere are four inversions of Cmaj6 (CEGA), starting on each note in chord. These are also four of the notes in the major 6th diminished scale.\nThere are four inversions of Ddim7 (DFAbB), starting on each note in the chord. These are also the four remaining notes in the major 6th diminished scale.\nIt is possible to play each note of that scale as a series of maj6 and dim7 chords.\n\n\n\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nA\nAb\nB\n\n\n\n\n1st\n1st\n2nd\n2nd\n3rd\n3rd\n4th\n4th\n\n\nCMaj6\nDdim7\nCMaj6\nDdim7\nCMaj6\nDdim7\nCMaj6\nDdim7\n\n\nCEGA\nDFAbB\nEGAC\nFAbBD\nGACE\nACEG\nAbBDF\nBDFAb\n\n\n\nThis is basically where I am at right. I spent the morning locking my fingers into these inversions so I could play through the scale in chords. Loving the sound and the possibilities. Giving me lots to think about.\nNext up is to practice through the other diminished chords.\nDid a bit of that. Got through C, F, and Bb. Time to make another table for my reference.\nThis shows the notes in every the major 6th diminished scale. I think I fixed all the typos. The scales are ordered in terms of the circle of fifths, going anti-clockwise. The bolded notes are fully diminished 7ths."

I’m hoping this blog will keep me somewhat organized and motivated to stay on target.\nThe blog is built with quarto, and this post is just changing the structure a little bit so that each post is it’s own post, rather than a bunch of posts on a single page."

Did this multiple times with each inversion.\nNoted that I liked the sound of the 3rd inversion the best. Ran up and down enough times that I could play fairly fluently, almost into melody territory. Will likely continue this sort of practice across other keys.\n\nAside…I’ve been messing around with huggingface models as a possible way to generate visual stimuli for some experiments this semester. The class of latent consistency models can generate decent images fairly quickly. This morning I downloaded the “dreamshaper-xl-turbo” model to test it out. Today’s blog picture was generated from this model."

It’s been a little bit painful because I am so out of practice. Perhaps there is a new year’s resolution here to practice more. But, what to practice?\nMy recent routine is working through the circle of fifths and reclaiming some basics.\n\nPlaying Maj7 chords anti-clockwise and then clockwise through the circle of fifths\nPlaying II-V-I through the circle of fifths\nPlaying V7-V7 through the circle of fifths\nPlaying I-VI-II-V through the circle of fifths. This is the same progression as in “Heart and Soul”, a duet we’d play as kids. Currently, I’m asking the question whether I can play this song effortlessly (chords in the left hand, melody in the right) in a key as I go around the circle, and if the answer is yes, I shouldn’t practice this key, and if the answer is no, then I should.\n\nStarting to get some fluency back. I was never that diligent at practicing through all of the keys, and some of them need a lot of work.\nIdeally, I’d like to keep a little journal here of practice strategies, reporting on: what I’m doing, what I’m hoping to get out of it (or did get out of it), and other observations that could relate to musical connections and/or connections to the cognitive science of skill learning."

    "text": "“A small penguin wearing headphones. The penguin listens to the music from the headphones. The penguin sits in front of a piano. The penguin can imagine the musical notes in a tornado above her head.” - LCM_Dreamshaper_v7\nI spent most of yesterday working through Wynton Kelly’s solo on Freddie Freeloader (from Miles Davis’s Kind of Blue). My plan for this post is to talk a little bit about what I did, and what I learned.\nA slight detour though. It’s been very nice to have some clear time to actually practice piano, let alone enough time to break down a solo. When I was a kid the advice was to listen to recordings and learn to play from them by ear. In some cases I was able to do this (with difficulty, because I didn’t spend enough time practicing this way), but for the most part I didn’t have the recordings to listen to. Flash-forward to today and almost everything is available to stream. That’s amazing when you’re trying to learn something by ear. Not only that, but the internet is full of musicians sharing their practice tips. It’s almost overwhelming, but in a good way.\nFor Freddie Freeloader I checked out a couple of YouTube videos before trying the solo myself: a transcription video and an analysis video. Then I played the song a couple times before heading downstairs. Here’s the breakdown process I used this time.\n\nPlay the original recording into a track on Ableton live\nCut the track so that it starts properly on the first bar\nTurn off “warp”, and then adjust the tempo of Ableton until the beats in the track line up properly with the bars in Ableton.\n\n\nThe purple track is the original recording. The selected area is the first two bars, and it is possible to loop the selection and/or slow it down without changing the pitch (by turning warp back on).\nI wasn’t particularly interested in learning the solo to play it note for note straight through. But, I was interested in trying out each little part and thinking about how the notes were used as phrases.\nSo, I worked in sections of two bars, looped each section, then played over top on the Fender Rhodes until I thought I had the line. The blue track are my 2 bar recordings on the Rhodes.\nI didn’t have time to get through the whole solo, just the first 12 bars, and it got a little messy at the end. Oh well. Had lots of fun.\n  \nPractice notes: I ended up practicing the first phrase through the circle of fifths this morning."

    "text": "“An underground lair of piano playing rabbits. Above the rabbits are the roots of carrots that have been eaten by rabbits as they play piano.” - LCM_Dreamshaper_v7\nToday’s exercise was running I∆7add9 chords through the circle of fifths.\nThe first row shows the notes of the C major scale with corresponding numbers. The 9th note is the same as the second note in the scale.\nThe second row shows the concept of constructing chords from thirds. From this perspective, you get all of the notes in the scale going up by thirds, but the 9th, 11th, and 13th note are out of their normal order.\nThis exercise focuses on the “rootless” 9th chord on the bottom row. That one has a major 3rd, a perfect fifth, a major 7th, and a 9th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n\n\n\n\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nA\nB\n\n\nC\n\nE\n\nG\n\nB\n\nD\n\nF\n\nA\n\n\n\n\n\nE\n\nG\n\nB\n\nD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the exercise I played these chords clockwise and anti-clockwise through the circle of fifths. I usually used my left hand for the bass note and to remind myself where I was in the circle. Then I played versions of the 9th chord. They all have a smashing pumpkins kind of vibe.\nOne reason I chose this exercise is to press harder on deprogramming my root conditioning. These chords don’t have the root in them, so they must be good for that (e.g., thinking about doing something in C, but not playing C, or only playing around C).\nAnother musical connection is that these 9th chords are the same as a III-7 chord. So, an E minor 7th is a C major 7th add 9.\nCognitive science connections: As a sidenote, my day job is a cognitive psychology professor who studies skill-learning. I’ve been meaning to do some piano skill research and I even have the keyboards in my lab to do it. So, as I go through these exercises it’s been fun thinking about issues like how does training on some musical ideas transfer to others.\nFor example, I’m already fairly fluid at playing the circle of fifths in different ways. If I’m playing single notes, I can go through the circle very quickly. It’s slower for chords, but still fairly quick. I’ve been practicing my 7th chords through the circle, so I can already go through the circle playing minor 7th chords fairly quickly. However, it turns out I can not do these 9th chords quickly. There should be pretty good transfer here because the 9th chords are exactly the same as the minor 7th chords that I have already practiced.\nIn terms of minor 7th chords I had been practicing these chords, with the root in the bass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\n\n\n\nE-7\nB-7\nGb-7\nDb-7\nAb-7\nEb-7\nBb-7\nF-7\nC-7\nG-7\nD-7\nA-7\n\n\nE\nB\nGb\nDb\nAb\nEb\nBb\nF\nC\nG\nD\nA\n\n\n\nBut, I had not been practicing those chords with the following bass notes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\n\n\n\nE-7\nB-7\nGb-7\nDb-7\nAb-7\nEb-7\nBb-7\nF-7\nC-7\nG-7\nD-7\nA-7\n\n\nC\nG\nD\nA\nE\nB\nGb\nDb\nAb\nEb\nBb\nF\n\n\n\nGeneralization is so fickle sometimes.\nAlso, I have some super-biased thirds. What’s the third of C -&gt; E. No problem, that’s fast. A -&gt; C, G -&gt; B. But, B ———&gt; Eb. That one hurts. Eb seems too far away to be a third. In any case. I need to flatten out this distribution at some point."
