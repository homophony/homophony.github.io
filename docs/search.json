It refers to the concept that experiences in memory may resonate with one another, like notes on a piano."

It’s been a little bit painful because I am so out of practice. Perhaps there is a new year’s resolution here to practice more. But, what to practice?\nMy recent routine is working through the circle of fifths and reclaiming some basics.\n\nPlaying Maj7 chords anti-clockwise and then clockwise through the circle of fifths\nPlaying II-V-I through the circle of fifths\nPlaying V7-V7 through the circle of fifths\nPlaying I-VI-II-V through the circle of fifths. This is the same progression as in “Heart and Soul”, a duet we’d play as kids. Currently, I’m asking the question whether I can play this song effortlessly (chords in the left hand, melody in the right) in a key as I go around the circle, and if the answer is yes, I shouldn’t practice this key, and if the answer is no, then I should.\n\nStarting to get some fluency back. I was never that diligent at practicing through all of the keys, and some of them need a lot of work.\nIdeally, I’d like to keep a little journal here of practice strategies, reporting on: what I’m doing, what I’m hoping to get out of it (or did get out of it), and other observations that could relate to musical connections and/or connections to the cognitive science of skill learning.\n\n\nGeneral set-up issues\n\nso many\nCan’t get a really good sync with Ableton. Don’t bother with any live processing from Ableton, unless it is playback only. Fiddle with the error compensation until the lag is gone.\n\n256 bits\n28 ms error compensation\n\nStill getting some audio dropout sometimes, not sure why.\n\n\n\nDolphin Dance\n  \nHave been messing about with Herbie Hancock’s “Dolphin Dance” on the piano for a while.\nHad a clear day to try some mixer mimicking. Plan was to develop my own voicings for everything, but mix them similar to the Maiden Voyage recording…and then jam it.\nWhat happened:\n\nRecorded the Hancock version into Ableton\nLocated BPM\nVoices\n\nRhodes\nMoog matriarch bass lines\nMPC drums\nOB-6 horns\n\nFor each voice, play with the original record. Keep recording in a loop using Ableton comping lanes\nFix messes by sampling in comping lanes/ explore have fun with fixing the mess\nDuplicate the head, then solo overtop for a bit\nMix it down.\nTry some final mixing touches."
