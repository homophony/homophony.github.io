</div></div><p>Yesterday I spent some time practicing the maj6 diminished scale across all keys. I also posted about practice ideas in relation to cognitive psychology phenomena.</p>
<p>For reference, I can play a C major scale in 7th chords in just under 3 seconds without any warm-up. I’ve had a couple days to put some practice into the C major 6th diminished scale, and I times myself at 12 seconds to play through the chords there.</p>
<p>I timed myself going through several keys for the first time, and B was the slowest at 104 seconds. Then, just for B maj 6 diminished, I did a focused spurt of practice for 10 minutes on that scale. This involved playing the scale ascending in chords over and over again, and not doing anything else. If I made a mistake I would correct it, and if I couldn’t correct it I would start again. I used a stopwatch on my phone for the timer, and pressed the lap button every time I finished the scale.</p>
<p>I was interested in measuring a learning curve to track my progress with this scale. The data looked like this:</p>
<div class="cell">

<p>The graph shows that I reduced my time to complete the scale by quite a bit in just 10 minutes of practice, from 104 seconds to 21 seconds.</p>
<p>That was yesterday.</p>
<section id="retentionsavings-in-re-learning" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="retentionsavings-in-re-learning">Retention…Savings in re-learning?</h2>
<p>My question this morning is how much did I retain? I haven’t practiced the B maj6 diminished scaled since yesterday. My plan is to go sit down and play it ascending for the next 10 minutes, record my playing times, and then come back here and graph it.</p>
<p>One possibility is that I’ll start off around 21 seconds where I left off, and then maybe get a faster. That would indicate I retained almost all of whatever I learned yesterday. Another possibility is that I start back at the beginning, perhaps having retained not very much at all. Still, if that happened, it’s possible that I would re-learn faster the second time through.</p>
<p>Let’s find out.</p>
<p>I just put in 10 minutes of repetitive practice, and here are the results.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output-display">
<div>
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://homophony.quest/blog/18_1_18_24_Relearning/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="672"></p>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>What happened? I ended up at about 20 seconds per run at the end of yesterday (last red dot), and today I started way back at about 60 seconds per run. That might look like almost no retention of whatever I “learned” yesterday. Yes, my first data point today was almost twice as fast as the first one from yesterday, but that could be an outlier. I remember making loads of mistakes the first time yesterday and restarting the scale several times.</p>
<p>Although my starting points are similar, it appears there was a decent amount of savings in relearning. Savings in relearning is a concept from <a href="https://www.crumplab.com/cognition/textbook/C8_Memory_I.html#ebbinghauss-forgetting">Hermann Ebbinghaus</a> and his research on forgetting. Ebbinghaus spent time learning lists of random syllables until he could recite them, and then he waited different amounts of time before trying to recall them from memory. Not surprisingly, he forgot items over time. However, he would also relearn lists a second time, after the delay, and often found savings in his relearning attempt. Even though he had forgotten items from the list, when he tried to relearn the list, it took less time (than the initial learning attempt) before he could recite it perfectly again.</p>
<p>Something similar is going on here. One possibility is that I forgot everything I learned since yesterday, and that’s why I was back at the beginning. However, even though the data show I was basically back at the beginning, it seems my practice from yesterday helped me relearn faster than before. The green dots go down faster over practice attempts than the red dots. Yesterday I only got 15 scales completed in 10 minutes, but this time I got through 30 attempts. I also got my time down to 8 or 9 seconds by the end.</p>

<p>Barry Harris - courtesy wikipedia</p>
</div></div><p>A couple of days ago I stumbled across the Barry Harris system as taught by one of his students Shan Verma, who also runs <a href="https://www.jazzskills.com" class="uri">https://www.jazzskills.com</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve been randomly watching a few videos from his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JazzSkills">youtube channel</a> and trying a few things out.</p>
<p>All of the practice is around learning the major 6th diminished scale, which has some very interesting properties, and sounds great.</p>
<p>These two videos show the two primary ideas for today’s practice.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oALZ7xcEdJY&amp;list=PL2GT-F7_oAbkEGy3Sm5jjoowPJLGs6Zzd&amp;index=1">basics of the major 6th diminished scale</a>.</li>

</ul>
<section id="what-i-did-so-far" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-i-did-so-far">What I did so far</h2>
<p>Woke up and played the scale using alternating maj6 and dim7 chords. Played through C, F, and Bb. Also, ran through the building up notes exercise in each key, starting from each note in the scale for each key.</p>
</section>
<section id="practice-notes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="practice-notes">Practice notes</h2>
<p><strong>C scale notes</strong>. I was playing through this one last night as well. In particular, I was attempting to get the ‘building up notes’ exercise fluid. If I played each step like a new chord it felt chunky. If I played each step like an ascending run in the right hand, and simultaneous descending run in the left hand it was fast. However, when I did those runs I was only playing single notes, and leaving out the internal notes that form the maj6 or dim7 chords. Then, I got into the swing of alternating my fingers properly.</p>
<p>The table shows the fingering for thumb to pinky (1-5), for the left and right hands. Start with both thumbs on the same note. Then, the index to pinky (2345) go on every note ascending on the right, and every note descending on the left.</p>

<p>Took a little while, but once the symmetry hits the fingering locked in pretty easily.</p>
<p>In C, starting from the Ab has a particularly nice symmetrical viewpoint.</p>
<p><strong>F scale notes</strong>. Practice went pretty well. This scale uses a different dim7 chord (GBbDdE). Felt like a little bit of interference from C. The Fmaj6 chord has the same shape and fingering as Cmaj6.</p>
<p>As I was playing the building up notes exercise through every note, I started to think more about how I could use the exercise. I started asking questions like, where does this movement want to go? For example, starting on the root, and “building up notes” seems to want to resolve on the V.</p>
<p><strong>Bb scale notes</strong>. These observations would apply to any of the other scales, but I roughly had these thoughts around this time in practice. So, I’m going to stop organizing notes by scale.</p>

<p>Noodling around in CMaj6…lots of CEGA. I started building up on C.</p>

<li><p>step 2. playing a BD is nice. It’s not part of CEGA, but it adds the maj7 and 9th. Easy to sprinkle in whenever, even if staying on CMaj6. sprinkles of possible movement.</p></li>

<p>Still playing over a Cmaj6, I did a little bit of starting the building up notes on different notes, but not too much. Need to do that more, to get a better sense of the directions.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-a-step-in-the-building-up-exercise-provides">What a step in the building up exercise provides</h3>
<p>The building up notes exercise starts by emphasizing some particular note in the scale. This could be where you are at, say in a melody. Then, it alternates between adding the next notes in a maj6 chord, or a dim7 chord. I should sit down and spell this out for myself at some point after I get the fingering down across keys.</p>
<ul>
<li>in general, the exercise provides a way to start on a note in the scale, transition between restating aspects of the root (through the maj6), or the diminshed 7th chord, with very harmonious sounding transitions. The transitions already have a bit of movement, and they set up off-ramps into other directions. Especially from a dim7th chord, which can easily end up as four different 7th chords.</li>
</ul>

<section id="cognitive-science-notes-proactive-interference" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cognitive-science-notes-proactive-interference">Cognitive science notes: proactive interference</h3>
<p>Proactive interference is a well-known phenomena in the learning and memory literature. The classic finding is from studies of free recall. Participants are given lists of items to study, like words, and then after a delay they are asked to recall as many as possible from the list. Pro-active interference occurs when your memory for items in the list is impaired by previous exposure and/or learning attempts to memorize other lists.</p>
<p><img src="https://homophony.quest/blog/17_1_17_24_BarryHarris/images/Screenshot 2024-01-17 at 9.44.43 AM.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The figure shows some recall data from Underwood (1957). The x-axis is number of previous lists. Some subjects were new to these kinds of studies, and they had not tried to memorize lists of items before. Their recall was pretty high. Other subjects had participated in these kinds of studies before, and had tried to memorize many different lists (up to 20 different lists). The more lists one had previously tried to learn, the worse participants did when trying to learn and recall a new list.</p>
<p>As I try to learn the maj6th diminished scale across all of the keys I’m wondering about the role of pre-active interference, as well as other kinds of interference. If learning scales was like learning random lists of words, then it is possible that every time I learn one scale, the next scale becomes harder to learn because of this so-called pro-active interference. My general sense is that this isn’t how learning scales works in practice, and that prior experience generally helps with learning new things. Not to say that there isn’t sometimes interference.</p>
<p>Eb practice…got through it, thought a little more about pro-active interference, and “task-switching” or key-switching.</p>
<p>It’s not clear to me that findings showing pro-active interference in free recall should neatly generalize to learning scales. One reason is that the free-recall studies usually used arbitrary lists of items with no particular relationships to one another. Part of the pro-active interference is that one accidentally recalls words from a previous list, and those get counted as errors. Also, learning additional lists of random items is like trying to grow a vocabulary of random words with no particular meaning.</p>
<p>In contrast to random lists of words, musical scales have many shared elements across keys. There is lots of opportunity for facilitation and interference. For example, learning to play the dim7 in the C major 6th diminished scale could facilitate learning the Eb, Gb, and A versions of that scale, because they use the same dim7 chord. At the same time, there could be associative interference at play based on prior learning attempts. For example, learning to interleave CEGA with DFAbB(dim7) could reinforce those interchord assocations, such as C6-Ddim7-E6. Then, consider moving to learn Eb major 6th diminshed. There is a C6-Ddim7-Eb6, and perhaps here the E6 will interfere with the Eb6? I wonder what a MINERVA process would do here…</p>
</section>
<section id="cogsci-notes-key-switching-costs" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cogsci-notes-key-switching-costs">Cogsci notes: Key-switching costs</h3>
<p>Another classic finding in cognition is called the task-switching cost. This has been demonstrated in diverse task situations. The basic finding is that there are usually costs, in terms of time and accuracy, when switching from one task to another.</p>
<p>I’ve been practicing the build up exercise in C, F, Bb, and Eb. The fingerings are all different, but similar enough that my fluency is getting better, even as I switch to new keys.</p>
<p>These four keys share some notes. For example, C appears in all of C, F, Bb, and Eb scales. I did practice the build up for all four, across all notes of the scale, which means that I did start on C and do the build up for each key. However, I practiced the build up ascending and descending within each scale.</p>
<p>I am 100% experiencing pretty strong key-switching costs if I start on C alone, and try to then produce a build in the key of F, Bb, or Eb. It’s much easier to start on C major. Need to break out of the switch cost by practicing these more.</p>
<p>A musical benefit is that a build-up exercise starting say on C, can take you in lots of places, by building up into different keys from that one note. Opening so much opportunity for movement. Wow.</p>
</section>
<section id="cogsci-notes-spacing-and-repetition-during-practice" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cogsci-notes-spacing-and-repetition-during-practice">Cogsci notes: Spacing and repetition during practice</h3>
<p>Another well-known set of phenomena in learning and memory are spacing and repetition effects. I have been thinking about these phenomena as I’ve been practicing, and I was probably thinking more about these than what I was trying to accomplish in Ab as I was learning the maj6 diminished scale in that key.</p>
<p>Spacing effects seem to be a common export of cognitive psychology, especially in various apps for ‘optimizing’ learning. For example, flashcard apps and language learning apps will build in a spacing algorithm. The purpose of the algorithm is to space out repetitions during practice, which can facilitate learning and memory (whether or not spacing effects have positive or negative benefits, or no effect can depend).</p>
<p>Repetition effects are another commonly studied phenomena. In general, repeatedly practicing an action, movement pattern, or series of movements, increases the fluency and “automaticity” of the action. Musician’s know this very well. If you haven’t practiced a Gb scale before, or in a while, your performance will be slow and error-prone. If you repeatedly play the scale up and down and up and down, over and over, it get’s easier, and your performance will become faster and more accurate. Repetitions can also make performance worse sometimes (but I’ll skip over those cogsci things for now).</p>
<p>Studies of practicing motor skills, like learning scales, typically show that performance gains follow a power or exponential functions (both are very similar looking), like the one below.</p>
<p><img src="https://homophony.quest/blog/17_1_17_24_BarryHarris/images/practice curve.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The general outcome is that measures of fluency, like scale speed, increase with more practice. However, the gains that are made with practice decrease. The biggest gains in performance are seen early on in practice, afterwards, it takes a lot of practice to make very tiny gains. There are lots of reasons for this basic curve. On a piano, one issue is that people can only move their fingers up to some limit, so there are hard limits to the floor of the function. And, it may take loads of practice to approach those near floor limits.</p>
<p>A related concept with repetitive practice is the idea of diminished returns. Repetitive practice will increase fluency for sure, but at some point in practice one becomes fluent enough, and further practice isn’t going to do much. So, the question becomes when to stop repeating and move onto something else? Which leads back to the spacing of repetitions question.</p>
<p>Let’s say you are trying to practice major scales in all of the keys. What kind of practice schedule should one adopt? There are lots of options, and depending on how you arrange things, the repeated attempts can be massed together or spread out. I’ve got more to say about this kind of stuff, but will get back to practicing Gb. Although, it would be possible to get fancy and use concepts from cognition, I’m just going through the circle of fifths. This has musical benefits, and moving in that direction involves going from one key to another that share many notes. As a result, I think I get a little bit of facilitation from learning one scale to another, and also a little of bit of a discriminative challenge to make sure I’m not playing the previous one. Seems like a productive level of difficulty.</p>
<p>Lunch break</p>
</section>
<section id="turning-up-the-interference" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="turning-up-the-interference">Turning up the interference</h3>
<p>All the above being said, over lunch I was wondering about maximum interference practice schedules. For example, consider this build-up note exercise. I could write a computer program to tell me what note to start on, and what key to build on, and have this be totally random. That would be a great little practice tool (note to self to make some midi javascript stuff later). But, it would be hard. Especially for me right now because I don’t know the build-up patterns in most keys yet.</p>
<p>Something more approachable, but still hard, would be for me to do much less repetition as I practice the remaining keys (I think I have about 8 left). Up until this point, I have been doing a lot of varied practice within each key. Something like this for each key:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>play the all the notes of the scale up and down, and all around</p></li>
<li><p>play them all at the same time to “see the notes all together”</p></li>
<li><p>play them in sets of 4 or 5, starting on different notes</p></li>
<li><p>play them up and down starting on different notes</p></li>
<li><p>play the maj6 inversions as chords, then as arpeggios</p></li>
<li><p>play the dim7 inversions as chords, then as arpeggios</p></li>
<li><p>put the alternating chords together, play through the scale up and down in chords</p></li>
<li><p>play through the scale up an down in arpeggios</p></li>
<li><p>Start playing the build-up exercise on each note of the scale. Do this up and down and all around</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That’s a lot of different kinds of repetition, and it seems to work pretty well. My fingers get used to the pattern of notes in the key, and then I’m on my way. Still, playing the scale in terms of chords is slow at first, and I’m not getting very fast, but it does become comfortably slow fairly quickly.</p>
<p>A different sort of practice schedule would be more painful. For example, I could go immediately to playing the chords of the maj6 diminished scaled in Db, which is the next key I need to practice. This will be new for me, and I know it will take sometimes a few seconds or more of staring and thinking, and getting a bit lost, to press the first chord, and then the second and so on. I will be working it out on the fly. After going up the scale one time, I could decide to stop Db, and switch to Gb (the next one in my anti-clockwise circle of fifths practice cycle). That would be new and somewhat painful too. In other words, the harder, less repetitive, more spaced out practice schedule could be: once up then switch to new key.</p>
<p>Maybe I will try this next I’m not sure if I have the patience for it…as I like to feel the progress. However, I can imagine some potentially interesting side effects (benefits? or at least potential consequences) of this switchy schedule. One possibility is that this schedule may increase associative linkages between a current musical goal and an intended outcome. One reason this might happen is that when attempting new patterns, the goal may be clear (e.g., play the third chord of the maj6 dim scale in Gb), but the action and corresponding pattern may not be clear. So, one is keeping the goal in mind as an instruction, and trying to work out the pattern, and then execute. As a result, this constitutes a processing episode where the goal was in mind at the same time as a puzzling out process, as well as an action being executed. According some theories of learning and memory the things that happen during an episode of learning are preserved in memory, and later retrieved when similar circumstance are re-encountered. Not sure what the practical consequences would be for learning scales in this manner…maybe I should go try this.</p>
<p>Alright…not as bad as I thought that would feel. Here’s a practice table with some scale completion time data:</p>
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Key</th>
<th>Finishing time (minutes)</th>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

</table>
<p>This was pretty slow going, and fairly cognitively taxing. Was constantly reminding myself what I was trying to do, while puzzling out what to play. Not too bad though. Perhaps this caused me to make some more deliberate connections than I otherwise would have, not sure. My times were generally getting faster as I moved anti-clockwise, but that could reflect my overall fluency in those keys in general. I hadn’t tried the major 6 dim scale in any of these keys before and all the completion times (to play the chord for each note ascending) are about a minute or longer. By comparison, I went back to the piano and played through the C scale in 12 seconds…still pretty slow. For another comparison, I went back and played a regular C major scale in 7th chords in less than 3 seconds. Presumably with enough practice I get the above scales down under 3 seconds too. In C, I’ve already got down to 12 seconds. Not bad.</p>
<p>I had the worst time on B. I’m also curious on what kind of fluency gains I would make by just repeating this over and over. I think I should practice this a bunch of times in a row and see what the learning curve looks like. I’m using anything fancy, just the stopwatch on my iphone. I will play the scale in chords ascending, and press the lap button every time I’m finished. Let’s put in 10 minutes of repetitive practice and see where that gets me.</p>
<p>Done. And, time plot the data in R!</p>

<p>It’s not a pretty power curve, but at least it is generally decreasing. I was hovering around a minute per ascending attempt for the first 7 attempts. Then, a few things started to get easier, and I started speeding up. I cut my time by more than half, yah! Still a long way to go to get faster than 3 seconds. And, I suppose this gives me some perspective on what I got out 10 minutes of this kind of practice.</p>
<p>I’m going to try one more 10 minute burst for fun. This time I’ll do the scale in E, which was my second slowest time. However, instead of playing the scale ascending over and over for 10 minutes. I’m going to do whatever I want for 10 minutes, and see what happens. More specifically, I’ll take the list of things I mentioned earlier that I was doing, that helped me get my fingers into the key, and all that kind of stuff. Then, in the 9th minute, I’ll start timing my ascending runs. Maybe my more varied practice version of 10 minutes would get that scale into shape faster than just focusing on ascending runs…Or maybe not?</p>
<p>Did that. At the end I did a run of chords in E in about 20 seconds. But, my second attempt ended around 30 seconds with lots of errors. I was probably getting a bit better at all of the other things I was practicing, rather than being able to specifically do the ascending chords.</p>
<p>Also, starting to experience brain melt from too much piano practice. Maybe I should call it a day :)</p>

</div></div><p>Not sure where today’s post will take me, exciting times! The plan is to write a little bit in the morning, go play, write a little bit more, and so on. I’m hoping the writing will help focus my playing goals. Plus, I need to get back in the habit of writing everyday as the new semester approaches. So, win win.</p>
<section id="explanatory-and-descriptive-theory" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="explanatory-and-descriptive-theory">Explanatory and descriptive theory</h2>
<p>The title of this post is transitions. Mostly, I want to focus this on changes from one musical element to another. Before I head in that direction, I’ve been mulling over a more theoretical transition that has been helpful. My own mental transition from thinking about music theory as explanatory versus descriptive.</p>
<p>When I was first learning music theory (Royal Conservatory of Music, Canadian styles) I was a kid and didn’t have a wide exposure to different ways of thinking about music or theory in general. I remember working through music theory exercise books as homework. I don’t remember what was in those books necessarily, but probably they gave me a lot of basic names and definitions for musical elements.</p>
<p>In high school and early undergrad years I was still playing music when I could, and was getting much more heavily into jazz and improvising. I was also learning more about science, philosophy of science, and cognitive psychology, which shaped a general interest in theory. My day job is now as a cognitive psychology prof, and after many years of that job, the topic of theory still holds my interest. For example, in cognitive psychology a common goal is to develop theories that “explain” some phenomena of interest. Given the complexity of human/animal cognition, explaining how something works is usually a very tall order. This also raises the question of what gets to count as a successful explanation. Mechanistic theories are often held in high regard, as they would describe how individual components of some system work together to produce the phenomena of interest. Here, a phenomena is “explained” in terms of the way that it’s component pieces/processes work together.</p>
<p>When I became interested in learning “jazz” chords I was also scrambling to connect what I was learning back to music theory concepts I had been taught growing up. I can’t remember what my piano teachers had told me about what kind of “theory” music theory was supposed to be…I’m not sure that issue ever came up. Looking back, there were definitely a few years where I thought that music theory was somehow “explanatory”. For example, I would be analyzing a lead sheet trying to use music theory concepts to “understand” and “explain” why the melody went from here to there, or why the chord changed from this to that. Although sizeable chunks of a given song could be readily described using music theory concepts I had learned, there would be lots of changes that didn’t make sense to me. Sometimes a particularly inexplicable change would lead to hours of pondering possible contortions of music theory that might explain why something sounded good or made sense. I’ll give an example soon, but this is all to say that I was frustrated by looking toward music theory for explanation.</p>
<p>At that time I think I was missing the concept of “descriptive theory”. In cognitive science there are lots of examples of researchers using descriptive theories. Many of theses example derive from a logical positivist approach to science. Here, a primary goal is to predict and control a phenomena of interest. A common strategy is to create a descriptive system that can provide names for elements of a system, and mathematical functions to relate how elements move together or interact with one another. If a system can be well described using mathematical functions then it can be predicted and controlled. In this framework, the correspondence between reality and the descriptive system matters less than the amount of prediction and control achieved by the system. I’m getting too caught up here, and need to get back on track so I can practice more piano.</p>
<p>Here’s a point I have been slowly internalizing. Music theory provides a systematic way of describing some musical elements. But, it’s a descriptive theory, not an explanatory theory. Music theory doesn’t explain many important aspects of music. For example, it doesn’t explain how feelings of tension and resolution and created by musical elements. Music theory is not very generative. I may understand the C major scale, and the modes, and the chords that come from the C major scale, but this understanding does not show me how to compose any given song with C as a tonal center.</p>
<p>At least in my experience (and I don’t have an advanced degree in music theory), music theory is less of a theory and more of a naming convention system, rather than a fully worked out descriptive theory that a logical positivist would be proud of. Potato, tomato.</p>

<p><img src="https://homophony.quest/blog/16_1_16_24_transitions/images/2fg4dr.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
</div></div><p>Whereas earlier I would go down “beautiful mind” rabbit holes trying to “explain” a lead sheet from a music theory point of view, now I’m much more content for music theory to be the exceptional descriptive system that it is. Exceptional in the sense that exceptions are used whenever they are needed. And, that’s just the way it is.</p>
<section id="alice-in-wonderland" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="alice-in-wonderland">Alice in wonderland</h3>
<p>Here’s an example of the rabbit holes I go down from “Alice in Wonderland”. And, maybe it would all “make sense” if only I knew more music theory 🤷.</p>
<p><img src="https://homophony.quest/blog/16_1_16_24_transitions/images/IMG_0428.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The first seven chords follow a similar pattern, and there is more than one way to describe it. I used the blue pen to show the pattern in terms of leading 7ths being resolved to thirds in the next chord. For example, the first chord change is from D-7 to G7. In D-7, C is the 7th note, which moves down one semitone to a B, or major third in G7. In G7, F is the 7th note, which moves down one semitone to an E, or major third of C∆7.</p>
<p>Aspects of this pattern repeat until it starts breaking. The transition between B-7b5 and E7 is a little bit exceptional. Up until this point all of the notes are in the C major scale. If I was focusing on music theory as explanation I would ask, “what is G# doing in there?”. It sort of fits the pattern in that the 7th of of B-7b5 (A) is resolved to the third of E7 (G#). But, the pattern really breaks when going from A-7 to Eb7. Now, the 7th of A-7 (G) is repeated as the third in Eb7 (G), and all of the other notes in Eb7 (Eb Bb Db) are not in C major. There is also some interesting symmetry in the exceptions. The -iii7 chord in C is E-7, or EGBD. The E7 chord is close, and it sharpens the third EG#BD. Similarly, the Eb7 chord is close, but it keeps the G, and flattens the other notes, EbGBbDb. A kind of chordal call and response in terms of playing with exceptions to the C major scale.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to describe the chord changes from other perspectives. For example, instead of 7ths to 3rds, the pattern is also 1sts to 5ths. The root in D-7 becomes the fifth in G7. The root in G7 becomes the fifth in C∆7, and so on. This keeps repeating until the root in A-7 becomes a Bb in Eb7, which I guess is close enough.</p>
<p>My younger, and even older self on occasion, would get flustered by the Eb7, and consider questions like, “what music theory concepts make sense of these exceptions?”. It’s a fun question kind of question to ponder, but I’m more aware now of not getting too lost in pondering for too long.</p>
<p>Now it’s flavor over explanation every time.</p>

<section id="cocktail-music" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cocktail-music">Cocktail music</h3>
<p>Music is more like mixing cocktails. It should taste good and be interesting. I’m no mixologist, but I’ll mix up a Negroni once in a while with 1 part gin, 1 part vermouth, and 1 part campari. This cocktail is amenable to lots of variations. Switch the gin to bourbon for a boulevardier. Add a twist. Play with the ratios. Add little bits of more stuff for extra fun.</p>
<p>With the cocktail metaphor we can have an almost useless generic descriptive theory of cocktails. Cocktails are composed of multiple component parts, usually liquids, but not always, in particular ratios to each other. This kind of theory isn’t useful for making any cocktails. It can be useful to describe a cocktail using the system and then notice elements that might be analogized to other cocktails. For example, a negroni is 3 equal parts with lots of options for substitutions, implying a whole family of negroni-like drinks. So, the system could be used to explore negroni-style drinks by switching out pieces, trying different amaros instead of campari, etc. And, by giving names to components of cocktails, similarities may appear to arise between cocktails based on the collections of components. For example, the Manhattan is 2 parts bourbon 1 part red vermouth. It’s like a boulevardier, but substituting campari for more whiskey. In any case, I don’t need cocktails to make sense, they just need to taste good. And, they often taste exceptional when they contain some random stuff from left field that I never expected.</p>
<p>So, with music, the mood is to trod around in places that seem to have nice regular structure, and then throw in the good tasty flavors as much as possible.</p>
<p>And, now to the thing I actually wanted to write about.</p>

<section id="transitions-and-movement" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transitions-and-movement">Transitions and movement</h2>
<p>This should probably be a second post, but the above is a preface on transitions. I actually failed to state one of the main points I intended to make in the above discussion—perspective does make things seem different. Even though music theory is more of a descriptive than explanatory theory, the descriptions change perspective, even if they are describing the same thing. For example, a D-7 chord invokes certain concepts for me. It’s the -ii in C major. It’s D Dorian. It sounds a certain way, etc. That same chord in the 1st inversion is FACD, which is also an Fmaj6 chord that invites a different set of musical ideas. As a sidenote, it would be interesting to discuss these perspective shifts a bit further from a cognitive psychology perspective (e.g., in terms of the associative fan effect, and other phenomena).</p>
<p>Now, onto the main post.</p>
<p>On review, much of the exercises I have been working on lately are “noun” focused. I’ve been working on chords and modes mostly in the major scale, and trying to get all of that stuff more accessible to my fingers when I am playing. I could also call this “object” focused, where I’m trying to increase the fluency in my object production, where the objects are chords or scales. I’m getting better, so that’s good.</p>
<p>But, a question is looming that I have not been very actively addressing. These are questions about movement and transition. If I am here…where do I go from here. Where is there?</p>
<p>I need to start shifting my exercise into a verb focus, where I’m taking actions with musical elements, rather than just being a finger factory that produces musical doo-dads with high fluency for no reason.</p>
<p>Enter dominant chords, piano YouTube, and Barry Harris.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how organized the next stuff will be. Mostly a scratch pad.</p>

<section id="fully-diminished-chords-and-more" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fully-diminished-chords-and-more">Fully diminished chords and more</h2>
<p>I feel confident that I learned important things about fully diminished 7th chords when I was younger. But, I completely forget about them until yesterday when I started watching Shan Verma discussing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvxlzGReVA">Alice in Wonderland on youtube</a>.</p>
<p>This quickly led to a series of rabbit holes about fully diminished 7th chords, <a href="https://barryharrisinstituteofjazz.org">Barry Harris</a> and his system, and the major 6th diminished scale.</p>
<p>But, before I get to that. I need to go make lunch.</p>
<hr>
<p>Lunch break is over. Now, my goal is to put down some breadcrumbs and then get back to the piano.</p>
<section id="breadcrumb-1---fully-diminished-7th-chords" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="breadcrumb-1---fully-diminished-7th-chords">Breadcrumb 1 - Fully Diminished 7th chords</h3>
<p>These are composed of entirely of minor 3rds. So, a fully diminished Cbb7 is CEbGbA.</p>
<p>Randomly came across this <a href="https://vi-control.net/community/threads/dim7-chord-modulation-map-doorways-to-anywhere.99826/">series of observations about using these chords for transitions</a></p>
<p>There are only three different versions of this chord–C, Db and D–as the inversions cover all of the roots.</p>
<p>They are very useful for transitions.</p>
<p>Moving any note down a semitone turns the chord into a dominant 7th chord. Very useful for modulation.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="breadcrumb-3---barry-harriss-system">Breadcrumb 3 - Barry Harris’s system</h3>
<p>I haven’t had enough to time to learn what this whole system is. So far, I have just watched one youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q41nPrt0Ji0&amp;t=726s">video from Shan Verma</a> on this.</p>
<p>The trail of breadcrumbs started at the beginning of his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvxlzGReVA">Alice in Wonderland analysis video</a>. In that video he played alternating inversions of maj6 and fully diminished chords, and that immediately clicked something for me.</p>
<p>There are four inversions of Cmaj6 (CEGA), starting on each note in chord. These are also four of the notes in the major 6th diminished scale.</p>
<p>There are four inversions of Ddim7 (DFAbB), starting on each note in the chord. These are also the four remaining notes in the major 6th diminished scale.</p>
<p>It is possible to play each note of that scale as a series of maj6 and dim7 chords.</p>

<p>This is basically where I am at right. I spent the morning locking my fingers into these inversions so I could play through the scale in chords. Loving the sound and the possibilities. Giving me lots to think about.</p>
<p>Next up is to practice through the other diminished chords.</p>
<p>Did a bit of that. Got through C, F, and Bb. Time to make another table for my reference.</p>
<p>This shows the notes in every the major 6th diminished scale. I think I fixed all the typos. The scales are ordered in terms of the circle of fifths, going anti-clockwise. The bolded notes are fully diminished 7ths.</p>

<p>Same table again with some extra stuff. I started playing through these scales and was trying to figure out what aspects would be new to me. For each grouping of four, it is nice that that the diminished chord is the same, it is just expressed as a different inversion. Within each scale, the major chord is also the same, just expressed as a different inversion.</p>
<p>The new column simply points out the maj6/min7 relations.</p>

<p>This table could be useful for tapping into things I already know. I can play 6th chords fairly well, but I already know my min7 chords very well. Sometimes thinking about a chord in terms of another helps me play it, and it encourages shifting perspectives on the same thing. The Eb scale got easier to play once I realized the Eb6 was just a 1st inversion C-7 chord waiting to happen…and then I’m like, OMG C-7 is an Eb major 6th 🤯.</p>

</div></div><p>I’m not friends with modes yet. Barely an acquaintance, even after all these years.</p>
<p>Today’s practice is focusing on modes, yet again. This morning I am thinking of modes like a Donald Rumsfeld quote. Modes for me are known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns.</p>
<section id="modes-as-known-knowns" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="modes-as-known-knowns">Modes as known knowns</h2>
<p>I’m not sure when I first learned about modes, but probably some time in middle school. Since then I have– in a definitional sense– known what they were.</p>
<p>The way I encoded them as a piano player was in terms of the C major scale. There are 7 modes of the major scale, corresponding to each key of the major scale. Each mode involves playing the major scale from a different root note. This got turned into a heuristic like, play all the white keys from C to C…then play them from D to D, E to E, and so on. Those are the modes. That’s it. Also, the major scale modes have these Greek names:</p>
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Mode Name</th>
<th>Starting Note</th>
<th>Notes in C Major</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Ionian</td>
<td>I</td>
<td>CDEFGABC</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Dorian</td>
<td>II</td>
<td>DEFGACBD</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Phrygian</td>
<td>III</td>
<td>EFGABCDE</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Lydian</td>
<td>IV</td>
<td>FGABCDEF</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Mixolydian</td>
<td>V</td>
<td>GABCDEFG</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Aeolian</td>
<td>VI</td>
<td>ABCDEFGA</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Locrian</td>
<td>VII</td>
<td>BCDEFGAB</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The mode concept is a descriptive one. Other scales have can be described as having modes using the same principles as above.</p>
<p>That’s about as far the known knowns go for me. I don’t really think in terms of modes when I play. Also, that’s why I’m working on thinking in terms of modes again. For the extra flavor and different perspective that they bring.</p>
</section>
<section id="modes-as-known-unknowns" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="modes-as-known-unknowns">Modes as known unknowns</h2>
<p>There’s lots of other stuff that I in some sense “know” about modes. But, in practice, that conceptual knowledge is not well integrated into my playing.</p>
<p>The best example is that I never really bothered to automatize the modes across all of the keys. Oops. Here again is a strange failure of generalization.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I have practiced all of the modes across all of the keys. For example, over the past month I’ve been doing a lot of major scale work going up and down the major scale in every key, in every mode. I can play them all reasonably quickly now. So, that’s great. I must know my modes right? Not really.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I wasn’t thinking about modes, mode names, or modal relationships as I was playing through those scales. So, for example, I knew it would be hard to play C scales in the different modes. Of course I know C ionian. But, what is C dorian? Mind goes blank. Then slowly, “yes, C is the II of Bb”, so then C dorian is, “play a Bb major scale starting from C.” Then, what is the third mode even? Can’t remember…oh yes, Phrygian. What is C Phrygian? ummm….blah.</p>
<p>Of course, I can play an Ab major scale, but thinking of C Phygrian as Ab is one of those known unknowns. It’s the kind of missing connections I know are there, but haven’t bothered to glue together.</p>
<p>More generally, I’m hoping that working through modes will help me firm up these kinds of relations between notes so that they are within striking distance of my finger tips. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>C as a I (Ionian) in C</p></li>
<li><p>C as a II (dorian) in Bb</p></li>
<li><p>C as a III (phrygian) in Ab</p></li>
<li><p>C as a IV (Lydian) in G</p></li>
<li><p>C as a V (Mixolydian) in F</p></li>
<li><p>C as a VI (Aeolian) in Eb</p></li>
<li><p>C as a VII (Locrian) in Db</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And, then all of those same relationships for every note.</p>
</section>
<section id="modes-and-unknown-unknowns" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="modes-and-unknown-unknowns">Modes and unknown unknowns</h2>
<p>I suppose this is the stuff I’ll discover later on when I know my modes better.</p>
<p>One example from this morning was noticing patterns of harmonic ambiguity that are mildly interesting. For example, let’s say you play a C and G, which could be described as a perfect fifth in the key of C. What else could it be? Those notes are in the C major scale, so they could imply C Ionian. Those notes are also in the Bb major scale (the II and VI), so they could imply Bb as the tonal center, and in that case playing notes from C dorian would help fill in that implication. The same goes for all of the other modes of C (except for locrian where the G is diminished). And this is a fun little toy to play with, like a jack-in-the-box. Playing Cs and Gs is like turning the gear of the box, building expectations about what kind of jack will pop up, and then OMG, it’s a locrian scale.</p>
</section>
<section id="modes-by-accident" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="modes-by-accident">Modes by accident</h2>
<p>I still can’t remember the names of modes. And, I haven’t encoded them in terms of their accidental values. So, that’s why I am making this table. These are the different modes of C.</p>
<table class="table">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 17%">
<col style="width: 33%">
<col style="width: 20%">
<col style="width: 28%">

<tr class="odd">

</table>
<p>So, a new goal will be to play the modes in each key from this point of view.</p>
<p>The I (ionian), IV (lydian), and V (mixolydian) modes are “major” flavor, and the II (dorian), III (phrygian), IV (aeolian), and VII (locrian) modes are “minor” flavor.</p>
<p>I’m going to re-order the modes in terms of the circle of fifths.</p>
<table class="table">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 17%">
<col style="width: 33%">
<col style="width: 20%">

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>From this point of view there are five increasingly “minor” modes, going from Mixolydian to Locrian. Thinking in terms of what spices are added to the C major, the mixolydian adds a Bb. If you play a C and the dominant 7th (Bb), then there is a kind of question…how many more minor spices are there going to be? When I’m cooking a minor chord, there’s lots of spices to be added. There’s less major spice options, but throw in the tri-tone once in a while I guess.</p>
<p>More notes…The same table as above, using arabic numerals, and re-ordering in terms how the flats are added in the circle of fifths.</p>

</section>
<section id="modes-as-slashpolychords" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="modes-as-slashpolychords">Modes as slash/polychords</h2>
<p>I’ve seen different definitions of slash and polychords. One definition of a slash chord (say D/F#) is to play the numerator triad (D) with the denominator bass note (F#). And, a polychord would be playing one triad with the right hand (D) and another with the left hand (F#).</p>
<p>Another way to think of playing modes is in terms of slash chords or poly chords; or, I guess slash scales or poly scales. For example, consider a G/C. That could indicate a G major scale over a C bass note. Playing the G major scale starting and ending on C is the same as C lydian.</p>
<p>In the next table the note in the denominator is the root. The note in the numerator is the major scale to be played over the root (starting and ending on the root). The roman numerals show interval relations between the root and scale. For example, in the lydian column, the root is the fourth note in the corresponding scale (C is the fourth of G, G is the fourth of C). Modifying the major scale in the denominator by the accidental yields the major scale in the numerator (For Bb/C, flattening the 37 in C is B-&gt; Bb and E -&gt; Eb, which then turns the C scale into a Bb scale). The table is arranged in terms of the circle of fifths.</p>

</div></div><p>I’ve been really curious about the <a href="https://www.expressivee.com/2-osmose">Expressive Osmose</a> keyboard for a while now. So, I picked one up yesterday.</p>
<p>Basically all I have to say is: HOLY WOW.</p>
<p>I might have more to say later, and I may add notes to this post about the osmose as I go through the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y02SCLQSnzw">7 stages of osmose ownership</a>.</p>
<p>For, now I need to get back to pitch bending every note into a tornado of meowing cats.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Actually, this was the expressive controller/synthesizer I was looking for – reply to Obi-Wan Kenobi</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Early afternoon update. I have been noodling away roughly alphabetically through the 500 presets. I’m just starting the ones that begin with C. It’s easy to get lost in fun for hours doing this. Not that I want to take the fun away, but I should start integrating this a little bit more into my setup. Probably the next step will be recording the noodles.</p>
<p>Here are some notes so far on playing the osmose. These are notes to self to help me progress through this thing.</p>
<section id="velocity-and-pressure" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="velocity-and-pressure">Velocity and pressure</h2>
<p>The osmose has several dimensions of expressive control. Like most standard midi keyboards it has note velocity, but it also has pressure, aftertouch, and pitch bend for each key independently, with 24 voice polyphony!</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p><img src="https://product.hstatic.net/1000342432/product/1-roland-hp-5600.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
</div></div><p>A digression into my past life of utterly not liking midi keyboards. I grew up playing a Roland 5600 with a MC-300 (or 500?) and MT-32 (where much was had with the orchestra hit sound). I would go to my piano teacher’s houses for lessons on a real piano, and practice on the midi piano at home. It was fun to make different sounds on the roland, but I always wanted a real piano as a kid.</p>
<p>I still love the action of a real piano. It turns out I also love the action of my rhodes 88 key electric piano. But, I have never loved the action of any midi keyboard that I have ever owned or played. Not the hammer action ones. Not any of them.</p>
<p>In 2019 I got to play a CS-80 one time in Melbourne and I could not believe how much a difference polyphonic aftertouch made. It’s so sad that midi keyboards suck so much for so long.</p>
<p>Maybe I didn’t spend enough time with the other midi keyboards that I didn’t like. Most recently I brought home a Nord 88 key stage piano to use a controller, and it was just ok…one key broke, and there is an uncurable noisy power supply. Plus, these things never feel like an instrument to me, so they just constantly suck joy.</p>
<p>I have tried to adjust velocity curves and find something that seems better, but never got there. It’s possible I just don’t like how velocity is usually implemented, or that velocity is missing something for me. In any case, when I play on my acoustic or electric piano, even though both keyboards have very different action, they are both very playable and immediately expressive. I don’t have think about it, the expression is just there.</p>
<p>This is what I now adore about the osmose. The expression is right there at my finger tips.</p>
<p>I really like that they have pressure per key too.</p>
</section>
<section id="squishy-goodness" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="squishy-goodness">Squishy goodness</h2>
<p>It’s hard to describe what the action feels like. There is some initial resistance to the keys, but not too much. This is great for light and/or bouncy tapping and slowly applying pressure to the keys. Many of the presets make sound from pressure alone, and sometimes different sounds from pressure or velocity.</p>
<p>The aftertouch is the best feeling aftertouch I’ve ever played. There is a slight difference in resistance when you get to aftertouch land, and way more travel down into the aftertouch than on typical midi keyboards. It feels like the key keeps going down into it’s aftertouch home, where it belongs sometimes.</p>
<p>Similarly, the key’s pick up side-to-side wiggling throughout the travel of the key and into aftertouch range. This parameter is usually applied to pitch bend. It get’s a bit easier to wiggle when the key is pressed down a bit, but over all it’s very natural.</p>
</section>
<section id="presets" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="presets">Presets</h2>
<p>Lots of juicy stuff in the presets, all powered by <a href="https://www.hakenaudio.com/sound-engine">EaganMatrix</a>. It’ll be a while before I go into that thing.</p>
<p>There are a few onboard effects like a reverb and delays. The reverb can sound pretty good, especially with extend “on”.</p>
<p>I don’t like menu diving, and it’s pretty fast to make changes to sounds and to sensitivity parameters of the controller. Very happy with that.</p>
<p>Need to go play it some more.</p>
</section>
<section id="mpe-controller" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mpe-controller">MPE controller</h2>
<p>I’ve got it hooked up to the OB-6 and it works very well. Whenever I need the sound to go to 11, I just back it up with some OB-6. The more the scarier.</p>
</section>
<section id="recording-midi-in-ableton-live" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recording-midi-in-ableton-live">Recording midi in ableton live</h2>
<p>I was recording for a bit with one midi track and one audio track. Things seemed to be going fine, but Ableton started freezing up once in a while, and the midi recordings were sometimes really off. The likely culprit is me trying to record MPE midi for the first time.</p>
<p>It seems there are some MPE midi settings that are important, like from this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xxtjvn5PrUo">video</a></p>
<p>Still crashing ableton a bunch. A problem for another day.</p>

- not liking most/if any midi keyboards that I've used in the past.
- is this to do with how velocity is implemented?

Loving the pressure sensitivity along with velocity implementation.

Really fun icons for the macros and other controls

Fairly quick to access aspects of sound control...sensitivity adjustments are great, feels like I'm tweaking an instrument.
- a little awkward getting around...matrix

<p>I did my piano practice in A major today following the 7th chord themes from previous posts.</p>
<p>Then I accidentally spent too much time generating turtle cartoons with dreamshaper. So, I made a beat with the EP-133 and set them to music.</p>
<p>So many variations of the same thing.</p>

<p>Played the D major scale up and down using 7th chords. Did this multiple times with each inversion.</p>
<p>Noted that I liked the sound of the 3rd inversion the best. Ran up and down enough times that I could play fairly fluently, almost into melody territory. Will likely continue this sort of practice across other keys.</p>
<hr>
<p>Aside…I’ve been messing around with huggingface models as a possible way to generate visual stimuli for some experiments this semester. The class of latent consistency models can generate decent images fairly quickly. This morning I downloaded the “dreamshaper-xl-turbo” model to test it out. Today’s blog picture was generated from this model.</p>

<p>I’ve overplayed the C major scale for decades and should probably just stop practicing in C. At the same time, I can rip through the C major scale using 7th chords very quickly. In addition to practice, it seems easier to “see” the 7th chords in C major– they all have the same shape and use only white keys. It would be nice to have that immediacy for all of the other scales, and this is something I’m slowly working towards.</p>

<p>A tape cassette robot playing a drum kit. Massive speakers in the background. Super funky beats - LCM_Dreamshaper_v7</p>
</div></div><p>I have a really lazy habit with drum beats that I need to fix. It goes something like this: make a 4 bar beat, loop it, jam endlessly inside a 4 bar beat that gets boring and has no fills.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had some fun recreating a 4 bar beat from Quantic’s “Life in the Rain”. Today, the plan is to make this into a 12-bar beat with a reasonable amount of variation and some simple fills.</p>
<p>…Does some things in Ableton that didn’t take that long…Should do this kind of thing more often. Now I have a 12-bar drum part with a decent amount of variation. But, it’s on my upstairs computer and I need to get this into a new project on my downstairs computer. I’ve been using Ableton since forever and I don’t think I’ve ever tried to copy or import a midi track from one project to another. It must be possible. Going to play some music over these drums.</p>

<li>Record this thing into Ableton and grab the beat.</li>

<p>Sidenote. Attempting this on a new mac. I was going to record from Apple Music into Ableton, but I wasn’t setup for that. I used to use soundflower to route audio, and now I’m going to try <a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/">loopback</a>.</p>
<p>Really annoying to install on my new mac because of the process of allowing kernel extensions. ugh. Will it work? OK, it worked.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Here’s 8 bars from Quantic. The first 4 are a bit of cymabals, and the beat comes in on the last 4. It’s the last 4 that I’m interested.</li>
</ol>
<p><audio controls=""> <source src="main_beat.mp3" type="audio/wav"> </audio></p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Set up some drums in Ableton and MIDIfy this beat.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This took a little while. Not a huge fan of penciling in midi markers on my computer to make beats.</li>
<li>Set up a basic drum rack, found some close enough sounds</li>
<li>Used the EP-133 as a midi controller to pound in the beats, that was more fun</li>
<li>Nudged things around etc.</li>
<li>got close</li>
</ul>
<p>I ended up with this version of the main beat:</p>
<p><audio controls=""> <source src="midi_100.mp3" type="audio/wav"> </audio></p>
<p>Then, what’s fun with having everything as a midi note is to play around with note probability, and with adding hits that weren’t there, but now have a small probability of being there. Here’s an example of setting most of the sounds to a 50% probability.</p>
<p><audio controls=""> <source src="midi_50.mp3" type="audio/wav"> </audio></p>
<p>It’s more airy, but still carries the groove.</p>
<p>Practice notes: More or less accomplished the goal for this drum recreation exercise. Did not mix the drum voices to taste.</p>
<p>To Do:</p>
<ul>
<li>[] Use this somehow.</li>
<li>[] Learn a little bit more about saving midi clips/audio etc. in ableton so that it is easy for me to re-use this later.</li>
<li>[] See about programming this beat into the Varigate 8+, and or Hermod, so I have a modular version</li>
</ul>

<p>I had some time at the end of my semester to play piano more than usual. This semester that meant I actually played the piano, instead of not playing the piano.</p>
<p>Clearly I need to make time for more piano. I’m hoping this blog will keep me somewhat organized and motivated to stay on target.</p>
<p>The blog is built with <a href="https://quarto.org">quarto</a>, and this post is just changing the structure a little bit so that each post is it’s own post, rather than a bunch of posts on a single page.</p>

  <title>Freddie Freeloader Wynton Kelly solo</title>

<p>“A small penguin wearing headphones. The penguin listens to the music from the headphones. The penguin sits in front of a piano. The penguin can imagine the musical notes in a tornado above her head.” - LCM_Dreamshaper_v7</p>
</div></div><p>I spent most of yesterday working through Wynton Kelly’s solo on Freddie Freeloader (from Miles Davis’s Kind of Blue). My plan for this post is to talk a little bit about what I did, and what I learned.</p>
<p>A slight detour though. It’s been very nice to have some clear time to actually practice piano, let alone enough time to break down a solo. When I was a kid the advice was to listen to recordings and learn to play from them by ear. In some cases I was able to do this (with difficulty, because I didn’t spend enough time practicing this way), but for the most part I didn’t have the recordings to listen to. Flash-forward to today and almost everything is available to stream. That’s amazing when you’re trying to learn something by ear. Not only that, but the internet is full of musicians sharing their practice tips. It’s almost overwhelming, but in a good way.</p>
<p>For Freddie Freeloader I checked out a couple of YouTube videos before trying the solo myself: a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSjWOTbL5ew">transcription video</a> and an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxfawXcpuaQ">analysis video</a>. Then I played the song a couple times before heading downstairs. Here’s the breakdown process I used this time.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Play the original recording into a track on Ableton live</li>
<li>Cut the track so that it starts properly on the first bar</li>
<li>Turn off “warp”, and then adjust the tempo of Ableton until the beats in the track line up properly with the bars in Ableton.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://homophony.quest/blog/7_12_27_23_freddie/Screenshot 2023-12-27 at 7.56.08 AM.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The purple track is the original recording. The selected area is the first two bars, and it is possible to loop the selection and/or slow it down without changing the pitch (by turning warp back on).</p>
<p>I wasn’t particularly interested in learning the solo to play it note for note straight through. But, I was interested in trying out each little part and thinking about how the notes were used as phrases.</p>
<p>So, I worked in sections of two bars, looped each section, then played over top on the Fender Rhodes until I thought I had the line. The blue track are my 2 bar recordings on the Rhodes.</p>
<p>I didn’t have time to get through the whole solo, just the first 12 bars, and it got a little messy at the end. Oh well. Had lots of fun.</p>
<p><audio controls=""> <source src="Freddie_solo.mp3" type="audio/wav"> </audio></p>
<p>Practice notes: I ended up practicing the first phrase through the circle of fifths this morning.</p>

<p>“An underground lair of piano playing rabbits. Above the rabbits are the roots of carrots that have been eaten by rabbits as they play piano.” - LCM_Dreamshaper_v7</p>
</div></div><p>Today’s exercise was running I∆7add9 chords through the circle of fifths.</p>
<p>The first row shows the notes of the C major scale with corresponding numbers. The 9th note is the same as the second note in the scale.</p>
<p>The second row shows the concept of constructing chords from thirds. From this perspective, you get all of the notes in the scale going up by thirds, but the 9th, 11th, and 13th note are out of their normal order.</p>
<p>This exercise focuses on the “rootless” 9th chord on the bottom row. That one has a major 3rd, a perfect fifth, a major 7th, and a 9th.</p>

<p>In the exercise I played these chords clockwise and anti-clockwise through the circle of fifths. I usually used my left hand for the bass note and to remind myself where I was in the circle. Then I played versions of the 9th chord. They all have a smashing pumpkins kind of vibe.</p>
<p>One reason I chose this exercise is to press harder on deprogramming my root conditioning. These chords don’t have the root in them, so they must be good for that (e.g., thinking about doing something in C, but not playing C, or only playing around C).</p>
<p>Another musical connection is that these 9th chords are the same as a III-7 chord. So, an E minor 7th is a C major 7th add 9.</p>
<p>Cognitive science connections: As a sidenote, my day job is a cognitive psychology professor who studies skill-learning. I’ve been meaning to do some piano skill research and I even have the keyboards in my lab to do it. So, as I go through these exercises it’s been fun thinking about issues like how does training on some musical ideas transfer to others.</p>
<p>For example, I’m already fairly fluid at playing the circle of fifths in different ways. If I’m playing single notes, I can go through the circle very quickly. It’s slower for chords, but still fairly quick. I’ve been practicing my 7th chords through the circle, so I can already go through the circle playing minor 7th chords fairly quickly. However, it turns out I can not do these 9th chords quickly. There should be pretty good transfer here because the 9th chords are exactly the same as the minor 7th chords that I have already practiced.</p>
<p>In terms of minor 7th chords I had been practicing these chords, with the root in the bass.</p>

<p>Generalization is so fickle sometimes.</p>
<p>Also, I have some super-biased thirds. What’s the third of C -&gt; E. No problem, that’s fast. A -&gt; C, G -&gt; B. But, B ———&gt; Eb. That one hurts. Eb seems too far away to be a third. In any case. I need to flatten out this distribution at some point.</p>

<p>I’ve been taking practice inspiration from Mark Levine’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jazz-Theory-Book-Mark-Levine/dp/1883217040">Jazz Theory Book</a>. This exercise wasn’t in there specifically, but it’s in the spirit of root-bias deprogramming.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p><img src="https://homophony.quest/blog/5_12_25_23_7thFirst/levine.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
</div></div><p>Levine has these fun quips throughout that I’m trying to follow through on:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Remember, practice all scales and patterns both ascending and descending; on the major, melodic minor, diminished, and whole-tone scales and in all keys</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>You’ve now learned about all four of the scales you’ll need under your fingers to play over chord changes. The next question is how to practice them. And you don’t just want to practice them, but to internalize them to the point where they become an <strong>available pool of notes</strong>, on which to improvise.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>…the goal is to deprogram yourself from years of root-bias conditioning</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I learned piano in the classical music tradition and practiced all my scales and chords in a massively root-biased way when I was a kid. So, one of my goals right now is to think about chords from non-root perspectives.</p>
<p>For example, in this exercise my goal is to practice leading with the 7th note. This is related to the exercise from yesterday, but I did few things differently. Here’s the idea:</p>
<p><img src="https://homophony.quest/blog/5_12_25_23_7thFirst/7thfirst-01.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Play II-V-I chords through the circle of fifths</li>
<li>For each chord, lead with the 7th note, then bounce between the 7th note and each inversion of the 7th chord.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the first bar I have a D-7 chord in the key of C major. The minor 7th note is a C, and instead of thinking C = C major, I’m trying to also think C = D-7 . And, by doing this around the circle of fifths, you end up practicing every kind of 7th chord (maj, dom, min) for every key.</p>
<p>This exercise implies some related ones that I’ll get to some other day, such as leading with the 5th, or leading with the 3rd…and then leading with the weirder stuff (sus, b5, b9, #11).</p>

<li>Play each chord as an arpeggio, but start on the 7th and play down to the root.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notes: very easy to burn through this in C without thinking. G and F are decent, everything else is slow. Need to keep practicing the hard ones.</p>

  <title>Cycling through Major 7ths</title>
  <dc:creator>Matt Crump</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><audio controls=""> <source src="Maj7ths_01.mp3" type="audio/wav"> </audio></p>
<p>The basic task is to play Major 7th chords through the circle of fifths.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p>Circle of fifths</p>
<p>Going clockwise the next note is a perfect fifth from the previous note.</p>
<p><img src="https://homophony.quest/blog/3_12_23_23_cycling/circle.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
</div></div><p>Major 7th chords have a I-III-V-maj7 structure. These are the first, third, fifth, and major 7th notes in the major scale of the root key. For example, the key of C has 7 notes in the major scale: C D E F G A B</p>
<p>The chord C Maj7 (also notated as C∆7) is C-E-G-B.</p>
<p>Where C is the root or first note, E is the III, G is the V, and B is the major VII. The same pattern is applied to make Maj7 chords in all other keys.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this practice track I play chords going anti-clockwise through the circle of fifths:</p>
<p>C∆7 - F∆7 - Bb∆7 - Eb∆7 - Ab∆7 - Db∆7 - Gb∆7 - B∆7 - E∆7 - A∆7 - D∆7 - G∆7 - C∆7</p>
<p>I can probably play through this a bit faster, but not without making mistakes. One goal is to get the speed up both in both directions (anti-clockwise and clockwise).</p>
<p>Next, there is a short riff that I got from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CML0EgoqpxU">Nahre Sol’s youtube channel</a>, who has some other great recommendations for playing through maj7th chords.</p>
<p>Then, I end with playing ∆7th chords in my left hand and messing around with playing through major scales in the right hand. For example, if I’m playing a C∆7th, then I’m playing through the C major scale and so on. I thought I would have a better grasp on all of the major scales, but some of them are way out of practice. Yeesh. Baby steps.</p>
<p>A random observation about musical relationships that this exercise drew out. When playing anti-clockwise, the next chord remains ambiguous with respect to the tonal center: it could indicate a switch of the root, but maybe not. There isn’t enough evidence to go on based on the notes in the major 7th chords.</p>
<p>For example, going from C∆7 to F∆7 involves CEGB and FACE, all of these notes are in the C Major scale. So, the F∆7 chord doesn’t add any new notes, which in my mind allows some ambiguity about whether we are in C major still or have switched to F major. The F major scale has a Bb, which is the one note that makes F major different from C major, but this note is not voiced in the F∆7 chord. However, this “new note”, which would provide evidence that the root had switched from C to F is voiced by the next chord in the circle of fifths, Bb. So, in some sense moving anti-clockwise by one chord sets up a question—has the root changed?—and moving one more chord answers the question—yes—, but also asks the same question again, in a circle of fifths.</p>

<p>“A piano keyboard shaped like a perfect circle. Very bright and colorful. Lightning bolts in the sky.” - LCM_Dreamshaper_v7</p>
</div></div><p>Back into practicing the piano and working on my chops. It’s been a little bit painful because I am so out of practice. Perhaps there is a new year’s resolution here to practice more. But, what to practice?</p>
<p>My recent routine is working through the circle of fifths and reclaiming some basics.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Playing Maj7 chords anti-clockwise and then clockwise through the circle of fifths</li>
<li>Playing II-V-I through the circle of fifths</li>
<li>Playing V7-V7 through the circle of fifths</li>
<li>Playing I-VI-II-V through the circle of fifths. This is the same progression as in “Heart and Soul”, a duet we’d play as kids. Currently, I’m asking the question whether I can play this song effortlessly (chords in the left hand, melody in the right) in a key as I go around the circle, and if the answer is yes, I shouldn’t practice this key, and if the answer is no, then I should.</li>
</ol>
<p>Starting to get some fluency back. I was never that diligent at practicing through all of the keys, and some of them need a lot of work.</p>
<p>Ideally, I’d like to keep a little journal here of practice strategies, reporting on: what I’m doing, what I’m hoping to get out of it (or did get out of it), and other observations that could relate to musical connections and/or connections to the cognitive science of skill learning.</p>

<p>Have been messing about with Herbie Hancock’s “Dolphin Dance” on the piano for a while.</p>
<p>Had a clear day to try some mixer mimicking. Plan was to develop my own voicings for everything, but mix them similar to the Maiden Voyage recording…and then jam it.</p>
<p>What happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recorded the Hancock version into Ableton</li>
<li>Located BPM</li>
<li>Voices
<ul>
<li>Rhodes</li>
<li>Moog matriarch bass lines</li>
<li>MPC drums</li>
<li>OB-6 horns</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For each voice, play with the original record. Keep recording in a loop using Ableton comping lanes</li>
<li>Fix messes by sampling in comping lanes/ explore have fun with fixing the mess</li>
<li>Duplicate the head, then solo overtop for a bit</li>
<li>Mix it down.</li>
<li>Try some final mixing touches.</li>
</ul>
