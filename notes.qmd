# 12/25/23 7th first II-V-I

I've been taking practice inspiration from Mark Levine's [Jazz Theory Book](https://www.amazon.com/Jazz-Theory-Book-Mark-Levine/dp/1883217040). This exercise wasn't in there specifically, but it's in the spirit of root-bias deprogramming.

Levine has these fun quips throughout that I'm trying to follow through on:

> Remember, practice all scales and patterns both ascending and descending; on the major, melodic minor, diminished, and whole-tone scales and in all keys

> You've now learned about all four of the scales you'll need under your fingers to play over chord changes. The next question is how to practice them. And you don't just want to practice them, but to internalize them to the point where they become an **available pool of notes**, on which to improvise.

> ...the goal is to deprogram yourself from years of root-bias conditioning

I learned piano in the classical music tradition and practiced all my scales and chords in a massively root-biased way when I was a kid. So, one of my goals right now is to think about chords from non-root perspectives.

For example, in this exercise my goal is to practice leading with the 7th note. This is related to the exercise from yesterday, but I did few things differently. Here's the idea:

![](images/7thfirst-01.jpg)

1.  Play II-V-I chords through the circle of fifths
2.  For each chord, lead with the 7th note, then bounce between the 7th note and each inversion of the 7th chord.

In the first bar I have a D-7 chord in the key of C major. The minor 7th note is a C, and instead of thinking C = C major, I'm trying to also think C = D-7 . And, by doing this around the circle of fifths, you end up practicing every kind of 7th chord (maj, dom, min) for every key.

This exercise implies some related ones that I'll get to some other day, such as leading with the 5th, or leading with the 3rd...and then leading with the weirder stuff (sus, b5, b9, #11).

# 12/24/23 Scales in 7th chords

`r html_tag_audio("music/practice/scale_maj7ths.mp3", type = "wav")`

This exercise has two parts. Practice around the circle of fifths.

1.  Play the major scale up and down using 7th chords.

I^∆7^ II^-7^ III^-7^ IV^∆7^ V^7^ VI^-7^ VII^-Dim7^

2.  Play each chord as an arpeggio, but start on the 7th and play down to the root.

Notes: very easy to burn through this in C without thinking. G and F are decent, everything else is slow. Need to keep practicing the hard ones.

# 12/23/23 Cycling through Major 7ths

`r html_tag_audio("music/practice/Maj7ths_01.mp3", type = "wav")`

The basic task is to play Major 7th chords through the circle of fifths.

Circle of fifths

Going clockwise the next note is a perfect fifth from the previous note.

:::

Major 7th chords have a I-III-V-maj7 structure. These are the first, third, fifth, and major 7th notes in the major scale of the root key. For example, the key of C has 7 notes in the major scale: C D E F G A B

The chord C Maj7 (also notated as C∆7) is C-E-G-B.

Where C is the root or first note, E is the III, G is the V, and B is the major VII. The same pattern is applied to make Maj7 chords in all other keys.

At the beginning of this practice track I play chords going anti-clockwise through the circle of fifths:

C∆7 - F∆7 - Bb∆7 - Eb∆7 - Ab∆7 - Db∆7 - Gb∆7 - B∆7 - E∆7 - A∆7 - D∆7 - G∆7 - C∆7

I can probably play through this a bit faster, but not without making mistakes. One goal is to get the speed up both in both directions (anti-clockwise and clockwise).

Next, there is a short riff that I got from [Nahre Sol's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CML0EgoqpxU), who has some other great recommendations for playing through maj7th chords.

Then, I end with playing ∆7th chords in my left hand and messing around with playing through major scales in the right hand. For example, if I'm playing a C∆7th, then I'm playing through the C major scale and so on. I thought I would have a better grasp on all of the major scales, but some of them are way out of practice. Yeesh. Baby steps.

A random observation about musical relationships that this exercise drew out. When playing anti-clockwise, the next chord remains ambiguous with respect to the tonal center: it could indicate a switch of the root, but maybe not. There isn't enough evidence to go on based on the notes in the major 7th chords.

For example, going from C∆7 to F∆7 involves CEGB and FACE, all of these notes are in the C Major scale. So, the F∆7 chord doesn't add any new notes, which in my mind allows some ambiguity about whether we are in C major still or have switched to F major. The F major scale has a Bb, which is the one note that makes F major different from C major, but this note is not voiced in the F∆7 chord. However, this "new note", which would provide evidence that the root had switched from C to F is voiced by the next chord in the circle of fifths, Bb. So, in some sense moving anti-clockwise by one chord sets up a question---has the root changed?---and moving one more chord answers the question---yes---, but also asks the same question again, in a circle of fifths.

# 12/23/23 Practice

Back into practicing the piano and working on my chops. It's been a little bit painful because I am so out of practice. Perhaps there is a new year's resolution here to practice more. But, what to practice?

My recent routine is working through the circle of fifths and reclaiming some basics.

1.  Playing Maj7 chords anti-clockwise and then clockwise through the circle of fifths
2.  Playing II-V-I through the circle of fifths
3.  Playing V7-V7 through the circle of fifths
4.  Playing I-VI-II-V through the circle of fifths. This is the same progression as in "Heart and Soul", a duet we'd play as kids. Currently, I'm asking the question whether I can play this song effortlessly (chords in the left hand, melody in the right) in a key as I go around the circle, and if the answer is yes, I shouldn't practice this key, and if the answer is no, then I should.

Starting to get some fluency back. I was never that diligent at practicing through all of the keys, and some of them need a lot of work.

Ideally, I'd like to keep a little journal here of practice strategies, reporting on: what I'm doing, what I'm hoping to get out of it (or did get out of it), and other observations that could relate to musical connections and/or connections to the cognitive science of skill learning.

# General set-up issues

-   so many

-   Can't get a really good sync with Ableton. Don't bother with any live processing from Ableton, unless it is playback only. Fiddle with the error compensation until the lag is gone.

    -   256 bits

    -   28 ms error compensation

-   Still getting some audio dropout sometimes, not sure why.

# Dolphin Dance

`r html_tag_audio("../music/new/DolphinDanceFull_render 2_01.mp3", type = "wav")`

Have been messing about with Herbie Hancock's "Dolphin Dance" on the piano for a while.

Had a clear day to try some mixer mimicking. Plan was to develop my own voicings for everything, but mix them similar to the Maiden Voyage recording...and then jam it.

What happened:

-   Recorded the Hancock version into Ableton
-   Located BPM
-   Voices
    -   Rhodes
    -   Moog matriarch bass lines
    -   MPC drums
    -   OB-6 horns
-   For each voice, play with the original record. Keep recording in a loop using Ableton comping lanes
-   Fix messes by sampling in comping lanes/ explore have fun with fixing the mess
-   Duplicate the head, then solo overtop for a bit
-   Mix it down.
-   Try some final mixing touches.
