This could be a place where I make notes about music things. Not sure yet. We'll see.

# General set-up issues

-   so many

-   Can't get a really good sync with Ableton. Don't bother with any live processing from Ableton, unless it is playback only. Fiddle with the error compensation until the lag is gone.

    -   256 bits

    -   28 ms error compensation

-   Still getting some audio dropout sometimes, not sure why.

# Dolphin Dance

`r html_tag_audio("../music/new/DolphinDanceFull_render 2_01.mp3", type = "wav")`

Have been messing about with Herbie Hancock's "Dolphin Dance" on the piano for a while.

Had a clear day to try some mixer mimicking. Plan was to develop my own voicings for everything, but mix them similar to the Maiden Voyage recording...and then jam it.

What happened:

- Recorded the Hancock version into Ableton
- Located BPM
- Voices
  - Rhodes
  - Moog matriarch bass lines
  - MPC drums
  - OB-6 horns
- For each voice, play with the original record. Keep recording in a loop using Ableton comping lanes
- Fix messes by sampling in comping lanes/ explore have fun with fixing the mess
- Duplicate the head, then solo overtop for a bit
- Mix it down. 
- Try some final mixing touches.
